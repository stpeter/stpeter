    <summary>Although I pay no attention to the news, I'm vaguely aware that perhaps the world is becoming more negative and irrational. Rather than getting lost in despair and confusion, I try to model a positive, reasonable alternative by living the best life I can and by writing philosophical books that are clear, concise, and constructive. I've written six such books, with a seventh half done and an eighth outlined. Even though each of these books takes 500-1000 hours to research and write, I make them all available for free on my website (however, I do charge for the paperback and ebook versions). To date I've also made no effort to market them, so I depend on word of mouth. If you have found value in any of these books, I'd greatly appreciate it if you could tell a friend, write a review at Amazon, or give a copy as a gift. Thanks. :-)...</summary>

    <summary>I have become progressively disenchanted with, indeed actively opposed to, politics. More and more, I see it as a disease that has grown to take over not only the "body politic" but also the individual mind and soul. My enemy is the assertion that "the personal is the political", and that there is no domain of life outside of politics - not art or music, not love or friendship, not philosophy or religion - nothing. This idea emerged in the radical Marxist-feminist movement of the late 1960s, and was given canonical expression in an essay by Carol Hanisch....</summary>

    <summary>Today is the 200th anniversary of Henry David Thoreau's birth. To celebrate, I've published two books on his philosophy of life: The Upland Farm (a 50-page original exploration in the form of a journal) and Seasons of Thoreau (a 300-page compilation of quotes from his writings). Both books are available for free on my website, and can also be purchased in paperback and ebook formats from Amazon....</summary>

    <summary>A few months ago, in preparation for composing a cycle of poems on Nietzsche's ethical philosophy (now half done and provisionally entitled Songs of Zarathustra), I made the time to re-read my favorite book on the writing of metrical poetry: All the Fun's in How You Say a Thing by Timothy Steele. This also inspired me to revisit and revise some of the poems and translations I published years ago in my book Ancient Fire. Sadly, I discovered that those early poems were rather buggy; the translations of Horace were especially malformed and a few of them required major refactoring so that they would compile from a metrical perspective....</summary>

    <title>RFC 8141: Uniform Resource Names</title>

    <summary>Long, long ago on an Internet far, far away, some forward-thinking technologists defined several different types of identifiers called Uniform Resource Locators or URLs (for locating things - say, an article published online) and Uniform Resource Names or URNs (for permanently naming things without necessarily locating them - say, identifying a book by its ISBN no matter where a physical or electronic copy might be located). Some years later, a grand unified theory of identifiers was formulated, leading to the creation of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) including both URLs and URNs (and URCs, but who's ever heard of those?). Even though most URIs that we use today are URLs, URNs as specified in RFC 2141 have continued to be widely deployed, especially for bibliographic purposes and as XML namespace names. Because the communities that use URNs have felt the need to make some slight adjustments to the syntax and to align URNs with the formal definition of URIs, back in 2010 folks at the IETF decided to start work on a new document to obsolete RFC 2141. It took us 7 years (!), but here we are today with RFC 8141 to bring URNs into the modern age (almost exactly 20 years after the publication of RFC 2141 in 1997). Special thanks to John Klensin for co-editing this specification with me!...</summary>

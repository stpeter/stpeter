<h2>Freedom's Plow</h2>
<p>In 1943, three books were published that are dear to the heart of all thinking freedom-lovers: <cite>The God of the Machine</cite> by Isabel Paterson, <cite>The Discovery of Freedom</cite> by Rose Wilder Lane, and <cite>The Fountainhead</cite> by Ayn Rand. Yet those of a libertarian persuasion are less familiar with another great work published that year: the long poem <cite>Freedom's Plow</cite> by Langston Hughes.</p>
<p>Some years ago I <a href='/journal/300.html'>decided</a> to set all 200-odd lines of this poem to music. The <a href='/journal/340.html'>result</a> is a suite for voice and acoustic guitar that celebrates the foundations, tragedies, and triumphs of the American experience. At almost half an hour in length, it's a challenging piece to play and to hear. I plan to record it in the next few years, and to write an accompanying essay that does justice to this great American poem.</p>

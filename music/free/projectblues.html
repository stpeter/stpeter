<h3>Project Blues</h3>
<p>
Tear 'em down, tear 'em down<br />
Power to the people<br />
Tear 'em down, tear 'em down<br />
Human house for human people.
</p>
<p>
Government man say he's done his job, people are tucked away.<br />
He means out of sight is out of mind, that is what I say.
</p>
<p>
So I say: tear 'em down, tear 'em down<br />
Power to the people<br />
Tear 'em down, tear 'em down<br />
Human house for human people.
</p>
<p>
Well you might say that I'm just white bread, <br />
How can I know the truth?<br />
I say black white yellow red orange or green<br />
Only got to be human to see what I've seen.
</p>
<p>
I've seen black people white people left people right people <br />
Saying we got a solution<br />
To the "problem" of people living how they please,<br />
To the "poor people pollution" 
</p>
<p>
Hide them away
</p>
<p>
I've seen concrete warehouses asphalt jungles <br />
Housing people who got no future<br />
No jobs no hope just gangs pushing dope <br />
And we're all just looking the other way
</p>
<p>
See no evil, know no evil, no no evil
</p>
<p>
Tear 'em down, tear 'em down<br />
Power to the people<br />
Tear 'em down, tear 'em down<br />
Human house for human people.
</p>
<p>
New York, Chicago, Saint Louis, too -- <br />
People all over got them project blues.

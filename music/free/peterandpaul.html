<h3>Peter and Paul</h3>
<p>
We take from Peter to give to Paul<br />
To make one rise we make one fall<br />
And then we wonder at the enmities<br />
At natural friends who become enemies
</p>
<p>
Paul and Peter, Peter and Paul<br />
We fight the war of all against all<br />
It's only through your loss that I gain<br />
Your pleasure is my only pain
</p>
<p>
It's when I seek my life through others<br />
That I start to resent my brothers<br />
To hate their joy and their success<br />
Knowing that more for them means less<br />
For me -- a game of either-or<br />
Of true is false and peace is war<br />
Facades kept up that all are brothers<br />
While some are more equal than others
</p>
<p>
Paul and Peter, Peter and Paul<br />
We fight the war of all against all<br />
It's only through your loss that I gain<br />
Your pleasure is my only pain
</p>
<p>
Oh what a fragile bond we rend<br />
When first we start to tax and spend<br />
We turn our hearts to legal plunder<br />
We tear our free goodwill asunder
</p>
<p>
Paul and Peter, Peter and Paul<br />
We fight the war of all against all<br />
It's only through your loss that I gain<br />
Your pleasure is my only pain

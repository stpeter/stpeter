<h3>Do You See What I See?</h3>
<p>
Do you see what I see?<br />
Do you see what I see?<br />
People everywhere . . . 
</p>
<p>
I see people loving and hating<br />
And shoving and shaking<br />
And building and breaking<br />
And showing and telling<br />
And selling their souls for what?
</p>
<p>
I said do you see what I see?<br />
Do you see what I see?<br />
Do you see what I see?
</p>
<p>
I see nations fighting<br />
I see nations delighting <br />
In power and lust<br />
In power and force<br />
So I see masters and slaves<br />
I see masters and slaves<br />
Why do we keep thinking masters and slaves?<br />
I see people loving and hating<br />
And hating and dominating<br />
But we keep nominating the same old fools
</p>
<p>
And I said do you see what I see?<br />
Do you see what I see?

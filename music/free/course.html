<h3>The Course of the Sun</h3>
<p>
How high, we ask, has the sun yet climbed?<br />
We wonder, hope, but we do not know.<br />
No other star we can see so shines,<br />
And yet perhaps it's only show.
</p>
<p>
It can seem that our star has risen far<br />
At some times and in some respects<br />
But then past glory or future hope<br />
Becomes all that our world reflects.
</p>
<p>
Except the troubled ascent of man<br />
The world's not seen a star like this<br />
That rises and falls to rise again<br />
Abyss to bliss to precipice...
</p>
<p>
But looking closely the mind discerns<br />
That even when our sun grows dark<br />
In the molten core a fire burns<br />
Ignited by an ageless spark.

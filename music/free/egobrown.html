<h3>The Ballad of Ego Brown</h3>
<p>
This is a song about Ego Brown<br />
Trying to make a living in the capital town<br />
Trying to make a living in an honest way<br />
But the government boys say no way
</p>
<p>
Ego Brown had no place to stay<br />
Scraping by down Washington way<br />
Got sick and tired of the homeless blues<br />
Hit the street to shine some shoes
</p>
<p>
Now you might not think shinin' shoes<br />
Is any kind of job for a man to do<br />
And you got a lot of people on your side<br />
But for the man himself it was a source of pride
</p>
<p>
'Cause Ego Brown did it right and fast<br />
Gave them shoes a shine that was bound to last<br />
Did it so well that he had to expand<br />
Hired himself another homeless man<br />
And the homeless man he told his brother<br />
And the brother went out out and he told another<br />
And pretty soon mister Ego Brown <br />
Got a new kind of man on the streets of the capital town
</p>
<p>
But Ego Brown didn't know about Jim Crow<br />
How could he a-knowed he was gonna get Jim Crowed?
</p>
<p>
This is a song about Ego Brown<br />
Trying to make a living in the Capital Town<br />
Trying to make a living in an honest way<br />
But the government boys say no way

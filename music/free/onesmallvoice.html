<h3>One Small Voice</h3>
<p>
Mr. Politician, up there on the stand,<br />
I've got just one question for you and that is:<br />
Are you a god or are you a man?
</p>
<p>
Mr. Politician, I know mine is just one small voice,<br />
But there's only thing that I'm asking for and that is:<br />
Please give me no choice.
</p>
<p>
I'll give my body, my soul<br />
I'll let you take complete control<br />
Of all I think and feel and do<br />
I'll give my life and mind to you
</p>
<p>
Mr. Politician, make my decisions<br />
Mr. Politician I can't choose<br />
Mr. Politician you can't lose<br />
I'll give you my power of choice<br />
I'll let you speak for my own voice<br />
I'll give you all I've got to give<br />
Why should I have a say in how I live?
</p>
<p>
Mr. Politician, I know mine is just one small voice,<br />
But there's just one thing that I'm asking for and that is:<br />
Please give me no choice

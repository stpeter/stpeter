<h3>My Musical Influences</h3>
<p>The earliest influence on my songwriting comes from the singer-songwriters I grew up on &#151; people like Jackson Browne, James Taylor, Dan Fogelberg, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, Jon Pousette-Dart, and so on.  These artists define the main stream in which I work: acoustic folk-rock.  At the same time, I listened to a lot of progressive rock early on, especially <a href='/music/yes/'>Yes</a>, which helped shape my early practice of writing suites of songs.</p>
<p>Since then I have expanded my musical horizons considerably, both within the singer-songwriter tradition and into blues, bluegrass, reggae, jazz, and classical music.  In my later songs you can hear echoes of artists I didn't listen to in my teenage years, such as Bob Dylan, Lennon &amp; McCartney (and George Harrison, whose songs I like a lot), Cat Stevens, Joni Mitchell, Michael Hedges, Professor Longhair, Bob Marley, Duke Ellington, the medieval troubadours, and so on.</p>
<p>When it comes to lyrics I'm an intellectualist and a formalist &#151; probably a result of my study of classical literature in college and my overall intellectual tendencies (evident also in my <a href="/writings/fire/">poems</a>).  I've never been able to write lyrics that are more moody, free-flowing, and spontaneous.  I don't know whether that's good or bad, it's just the way I am. :)</p>
<p>In addition to something like 30 songs (not all of them included in <a href="/music/hagiography/">Hagiography</a>), I've written four extended pieces for solo guitar, which I've collected together under the title <a href="aubade.html">Aubade</a>. Because I am self-taught and not especially strict about technique, these works are not really classical works. Instead, they are something of a cross between classical, folk, and "new age" stylings. My influences here include classical composers like Bach, Albeniz, Granados, Satie, and Villa-Lobos, the self-described "rural folk pianist" George Winston, and the late guitar god Michael Hedges.</p>
<p>More recently, I've started to once again explore my first instrument: the electric bass. The first bass project I'm working on is a set of arrangements for solo bass of songs by the progressive rock band Yes, entitled <a href='/music/yes/'>Fundamental Affirmation</a>. The obvious inspiration here is Chris Squire, co-founder of Yes and my favorite bassist. Once I complete this Yes project, I plan to work on solo bass arrangements of music by <a href='/music/ellington/'>Duke Ellington</a> (thus paying homage to jazz bassists who played with Ellington over the years, especially Jimmy Blanton, Charles Mingus, and Ray Brown) and, I hope, a bass version of the <a href='/music/bach/'>Bach Cello Suites</a> (although I doubt I would be able to render them as masterfully as Edgar Meyer).</p>

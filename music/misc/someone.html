<h3>Someone New</h3>
<p>
It's clear you feel you've lingered here too long<br />
It's fear that they've grown tired of your song<br />
The season and the time are gone when you were someone new<br />
The reason and the rhyme are gone why they should worship you
</p>
<p>
So it's time to move on <br />
It's time for your song<br />
To change and grow <br />
You change too slow<br />
Where it counts, inside, <br />
Where you cannot hide<br />
Where the one that's you <br />
Is always something new
</p>
<p>
You wandered here to find that one true friend<br />
You squandered here your time until the end<br />
But the bitter waste you follow with sorrow in due measure<br />
Is a fitter taste to swallow than years of mindless pleasure
</p>
<p>
So it's time to slow down <br />
Time to settle down<br />
To change and grow <br />
To find what you know<br />
Where it counts, inside, <br />
Where your life's bona fide<br />
Where you're free to be <br />
The one that's really you

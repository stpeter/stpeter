<h3>New York Woman</h3>
<p><em>I wrote this song while I was in a bad mood stuck in Atlanta, Georgia -- don't take it personally, OK? :-)</em></p>
<p>
Well I been across the ocean<br />
Been all around this world<br />
But I only needed to cross the Hudson<br />
To find my kind of girl
</p>
And that's a New York Woman<br />
I don't like no other kind<br />
New York Woman <br />
Leaves the other kinds behind
</p>
<p>
Well I've lived down south and I gotta tell you<br />
A smart Belle's just a fluke<br />
And if I ever seen another brainless bleacho blond<br />
Preening herself in the rearview mirror<br />
Well I think I'm gonna puke
</p>
<p>
Just give me a New York Woman<br />
She don't live to primp and pout<br />
No, New York Woman walks so straight and proud<br />
Lord she makes me sing and shout
</p>
<p>
Well you can cross the Mason-Dixon<br />
You can head out north or west<br />
But if you just look 'round in Gotham<br />
Boys you're bound to find the best
</p>
<p>
And that's a New York Woman<br />
Puts the other kinds to shame<br />
New York Woman<br />
Ain't no woman quite the same
</p>
<p>
Well you can take your LA Woman<br />
And you can take your Southern Belle<br />
And you can take your Georgia Peaches<br />
All the way to hell
</p>
<p>
'Cause I got a New York Woman<br />
She makes me one happy Manhattan man<br />
And if she asks me what kind of man I am<br />
Well I say: I'm a New York Woman kind of man.

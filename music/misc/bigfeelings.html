<h3>Big Feelings</h3>
<p>
I never thought I'd feel so much so fast about a woman before<br />
But there's a flood inside my soul and it's almost more than I can absorb<br />
It's pulling me on when you're in my sight and it's washing away every trace<br />
Of every love I thought I felt before the day I saw your face
</p>
<p>
You don't have to worry about all the rest<br />
'Cause darling don't you think I know you're the best<br />
Ain't nobody's touched me the way you do<br />
Because . . . I got big feelings for you
</p>
<p>
The emotion that I'm feeling's coming through my eyes and it sure ain't something I can control<br />
Its power's got me reeling, it's a runaway feeling and it's filling every bit of my soul<br />
That naked little angel had me in his sights and he shot me down dead in the sky<br />
Well, I know I'm close to raving but the only thing I'm craving is to be with you the rest of my life
</p>
<p>
You don't have to think about what came before<br />
'Cause darling can't you see I already love you more<br />
I never felt so free the way I feel with you<br />
Oh . . . I got big feelings for you
</p>
<p>
Since the day I met you I've been wondering how<br />
You work your magic way into my life somehow<br />
All I'm ever wanting's to be close to you<br />
Oh darling, darling . . . I got big feelings for you

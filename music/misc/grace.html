<h3>State of Grace</h3>
<h4>Part I: Benediction</h4>
<p>(Instrumental)</p>
<h4>Part II: How Can I Thank You?</h3>
<p>
How can I thank you?<br />
I cannot fathom good so deep<br />
Benefaction, kindness, love<br />
What was your fine discernment of?<br />
I cannot fathom what I could be<br />
What you see that you love so deep
</p>
<p>
Did I try to destroy our love?<br />
I cannot even feel the source<br />
Of this horror this paralysis of mine<br />
Yet now you show what I've sought to find<br />
That you love me, that you love me<br />
And you say so simply "of course<br />
Of course I love you"
</p>
<p>
How can I tell you of the beauty I see in you?<br />
All I can do is give my thanks<br />
For my life again for this dignity<br />
For giving this depth of value to me<br />
It's so far beyond forgiveness and yet<br />
Our life can be my only thanks
</p>
<h4>Part II: Maker</h4>
<p>
My only thanks will be our life<br />
Responsibility<br />
Yet what destruction I have wrought<br />
I could have been no inspiration<br />
As you've always been to me<br />
But never truly have you sought<br />
Beyond our bond, outside our life
</p>
<p>
What was it drove me to destroy?<br />
I don't know, my love<br />
To see you build it up anew<br />
To watch you act for our own sake<br />
And know you act for yours<br />
Eternal genesis from you<br />
To hear "I love you, anyway"
</p>
<p>
Or was it fear that paralyzed<br />
The workings of my soul?<br />
Not really fear but puzzlement<br />
Or awe at such an act<br />
Incomparable no way to know<br />
This future full with wonderment<br />
This choice too large to analyze
</p>
<p>
Enough of gloomy deeds<br />
I'm through with love despoiled<br />
I'll be the one to build again<br />
l'll be the one unflagging this time<br />
I'll never let fear foil again<br />
The hope of my devotion
</p>
<p>
All life's a play? Well make it good<br />
With plot and theme and style<br />
And character bound up with all<br />
One whole complete alive
</p>
<p>
No cycle in pursuit of life<br />
Straight lines of love to you<br />
Those Greeks they'd know just what I mean<br />
When you call my acts poetry<br />
And I say I'm a maker

<h2>Peter Saint-Andre: Bass</h2>
<p>Why bass? Although I've played guitar since I was 13 or 14, my first instrument was actually electric bass. Indeed, for most of my teenage years I played bass in my high school's jazz-rock ensemble (led by Chuck Milazzo, who happened to be a cousin of Chuck Mangione) and I also played bass in a hard-rock band for a while. When I got into songwriting early in college I started focusing more deeply on guitar and even sold my old Fender bass. Yet bass lines have continued to speak to me strongly, and now that I'm not writing <a href='/music/hagiography/'>songs</a> anymore, I'm devoting renewed attention to my first musical love.</p>
<p>The initial bass project I have underway is a set of arrangements for solo electric bass of some songs by the progressive rock band <a href="/music/yes/">Yes</a>. It is in many ways a crazy project, with pieces as long as 15 minutes, but it has me totally absorbed. After that I hope to complete similar projects for the music of the rock band Rush and the jazz composer Duke Ellington, and perhaps even an electric bass version of Bach's Cello Suites.</p>
<p>As to influences, Chris Squire of Yes tops the list, followed closely by Jon Camp of Renaissance and Geddy Lee of Rush. I love their melodic style on the bass, which is almost a combination of bass and guitar. Guitarists Steve Howe and Julian Bream have also affected me deeply for their tonal variety and the orchestral quality of their playing.</p>
<p>The following words by Langston Hughes well capture my feelings for the instrument (from the poem "Easy Boogie" in <cite>Montage of a Dream Deferred</cite>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Down in the bass<br />
That steady beat<br />
Walking walking walking<br />
Like marching feet.
</p>
<p>
Down in the bass<br />
That easy roll,<br />
Rolling like I like it<br />
In my soul.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I play a gorgeous Minotaur bass created by <a href="http://www.veilletteguitars.com/">Joe Veillette</a> of Woodstock, New York. Here's a photo:</p>

<p>I have my Minotaur strung with D'Addario nylon tapewound strings for a more mellow tone, but I play it much like a classical guitar so my nails produce a trebly bite that would otherwise be lacking.</p>

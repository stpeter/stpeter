<h2>The Underlying Theme</h2>
<h3>Music of Rush for Solo Electric Bass</h3>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>Now that I'm nearly finished with my <a href='/music/yes/'>solo bass interpretations</a> of music by Yes, I'm thinking about doing the same thing with various songs by Rush. This project is in its earliest stages, but so far I am exploring the following songs for possible arrangement on solo electric bass:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Xanadu (from <cite>A Farewell to Kings</cite>, 1977)</li>
  <li>The Trees (from <cite>Hemispheres</cite>, 1978)</li>
  <li>Freewill (from <cite>Permanent Waves</cite>, 1980)</li>
  <li>Limelight (from <cite>Moving Pictures</cite>, 1981)</li>
  <li>Losing It (from <cite>Signals</cite>, 1982)</li>
  <li>Afterimage (from <cite>Grace Under Pressure</cite>, 1984)</li>
  <li>The Pass (from <cite>Presto</cite>, 1989)</li>
  <li>Ghost of a Chance (from <cite>Roll the Bones</cite>, 1991)</li>
  <li>Leave That Thing Alone (from <cite>Counterparts</cite>, 1993)</li>
  <li>Driven (from <cite>Test for Echo</cite>, 1996)</li>
  <li>The Main Monkey Business (from <cite>Snakes and Arrows</cite>, 2007)</li>
  <li>The Garden (from <cite>Clockwork Angels</cite>, 2012)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll update this page as I listen to more of the music that Rush has created over the last 40 years.</p>

<h2>The Underlying Theme</h2>
<h3>Music of Rush for Solo Electric Bass</h3>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>Now that I'm nearly finished with my <a href='/music/yes/'>solo bass interpretations</a> of music by Yes, I'm thinking about doing the same thing with various songs by Rush. This project is in the earliest stages, but so far I feel that the following songs offer strong possibilities for arrangement on solo electric bass:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Limelight (from <cite>Moving Pictures</cite>)</li>
  <li>Freewill (from <cite>Permanent Waves</cite>)</li>
  <li>Losing It (from <cite>Signals</cite>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll update this page as I listen to more of the music that Rush has created over the last 40 years.</p>

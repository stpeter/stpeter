<h2>Bach on Bass</h2>
<p>Bach's Suites for Unaccompanied Cello are the most sublime music ever written.</p>
<p>Many years ago I formed the aspiration of playing the Cello Suites on <a href="/music/bass.html">electric bass</a>. Although it's still unclear if I'll succeed, I've started to slowly climb the mountain.</p>
<p>Several recordings of Bach's suites have been made in arrangements for classical double bass, so an electric bass version seems broadly feasible. Because Bach was notorious for a certain kind of instrumental agnosticism, there would be nothing necessarily irreverent about an electric recording &#151; although it <em>would</em> be unorthodox. I see this as an intriguing experiment: not quite as radical as the synthesizer versions of Bach by W. Carlos, but definitely somewhat out there. Yet I am interested in this project not for its shock value but for its musical value, since I feel it would be a wonderful way to showcase the capabilities of the electric bass, and realistically the only way for me to play the music (and, if you will, get inside the mind) of Bach, the greatest of all composers.</p>

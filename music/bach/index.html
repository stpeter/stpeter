<h2>Bach</h2>
<p>In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812693337/monadnockA">Music of Yes</a>, philosopher Bill Martin likens the idea of <a href="/music/yes/">Squire Variations</a> to a modern version of Bach's <cite>Suites for Unaccompanied Cello</cite>. This has me thinking about the possibility of recording the Cello Suites for <a href="/music/bass.html">electric bass</a>. Several recordings of Bach's suites have been made in arrangements for double bass (the only such recording I own is Edgar Meyer's performance of Suites 1, 2, and 5), so an electric bass version seems feasible. Since Bach was notorious for a certain kind of instrumental agnosticism, there would be nothing irreverent about an electric recording &#151; although it <em>would</em> be unorthodox. I see such a recording as an interesting experiment: not quite as radical as the synthesizer versions of Bach by W. Carlos, but definitely somewhat "out there". Yet I am interested in this project not for its shock value but for its musical value, since I feel that this would be a wonderful way to showcase the capabilities of the electric bass, and realistically the only way for me to play the music of Bach (unless I can master the Lute Suites on guitar, which seems doubtful).</p>
<p>Although I have not yet started to work on this project, I do at least listen to the Cello Suites often. My favorite recording is on viola by Patricia McCarty, although I also like the versions by Stephen Isserlis and Janos Starker on cello and by Edgar Meyer on double bass.</p>

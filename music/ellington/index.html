<h2>Ellington</h2>
<p>I consider Duke Ellington to be the greatest composer of the twentieth century. In homage, I would like to record some of his music in transcriptions for solo <a href="/music/bass.html">electric bass</a>. Duke played with some great bassists over the years (Jimmy Blanton, Charles Mingus, and Ray Brown foremost among them), and it often shows in his arrangements. I'm not sure how successful I'll be in translating his fascinating tone-colors into music for bass, but I plan to try. So far I think such a recording might include the following pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ad Lib on Nippon</li>
<li>African Flower</li>
<li>All Too Soon</li>
<li>Azalea</li>
<li>Caravan</li>
<li>Heaven</li>
<li>In a Sentimental Mood</li>
<li>Lotus Blossom</li>
<li>Mood Indigo</li>
<li>The Shepherd</li>
<li>Shout 'Em Aunt Tillie</li>
<li>The Single Petal of a Rose</li>
<li>Solitude</li>
<li>Sophisticated Lady</li>
<li>Warm Valley</li>
</ul>
<p>As with the <a href='/music/bach/'>Bach Cello Suites</a>, I am not yet actively working on this project, aside from working on some early arrangements in my head.</p>

The additional information requested was as follows...

Selected Regions:       UNITED STATES

License Type:   Arrangement
                Creation of a new version of an existing composition.

The complete copyright information as shown on the first page of the original 
material about which you are requesting permission:

Exact copyright information varies by song, and the overall collection ("Yes 
Complete: Deluxe Edition" songbook, Warner Brothers Publications Inc.) does not 
have copyright information on the first page. Most of the songs are "(c) 
TOPOGRAPHIC MUSIC, INC., All rights for the World administered by WB MUSIC 
CORP." with the years of copyright for individual songs varying from 1970 to 1978.

Instrumentation (marching band, barbershop, show choir, etc.):
Solo electric bass

How is you arrangement different from original?

The arrangement is effectively a reduction of the original songs to individual 
works for solo electric bass; as a result, the music is much simplified (without 
vocals, and with the bass arrangement sometimes following the original melody, 
guitar part, bass line, or keyboard part). The song SAFE (CANON SONG) uses only 
the very last notes as an introduction to the song TO BE OVER. Themes from the 
songs THE REVEALING SCIENCE OF GOD (DANCE OF THE DAWN), THE REMEMBERING (HIGH THE 
MEMORY), THE ANCIENT (GIANTS UNDER THE SUN), and RITUAL (NOUS SOMMES DU SOLEIL) 
are used to construct a medley, with several short connecting passages added. In 
addition, the resulting works are arranged somewhat in the style of a Bach suite 
for solo cello (prelude, allemande, courante, sarabande, bourr√©e, gigue).

Any additional comments necessary to explain the purpose of the request and the intended use of our material:

A more complete description of this project can be found at 
https://stpeter.im/music/yes/index.html and 
https://stpeter.im/music/yes/liner.html (the idea for an arrangement of Yes songs 
a la Bach's Cello Suites was inspired by the book MUSIC OF YES: STRUCTURE AND 
VISION IN PROGRESSIVE ROCK by Bill Martin, Open Court Publishing Company, 1996).

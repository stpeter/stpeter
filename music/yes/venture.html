<h1>Fundamental Affirmation</h1>
<h2>V. A Venture</h2>
<p>The fifth movement of <a href='/music/yes/'>Fundamental Affirmation</a> is "A Venture" &mdash; a little gem of a song from <cite>The Yes Album</cite>, the first album in what Bill Martin calls their main sequence, recorded in 1970. This is the shortest and most straightforward of my Yes interpretations, flitting across in at a mere four minutes or so (sheet music <a href='A-Venture.pdf'>here</a>).</p>
<p>Here again I took a cue from Bach. The fifth movement in each of the Cello Suites consists of a two-part menuet, bourrée, or gavotte. Just so, the first forty measures of my arrangement (corresponding to the verse, "once a peaceful man") can be considered part one, and measures 41-135 (corresponding to the chorus, "he told all his sons") can be considered part two. Furthermore, as Bach does, I return briefly at the end to part one.</p>
<p>The harmonic materials of "A Venture" are quite interesting. Although almost all the notes are those of the G minor (or B♭ major) scale, Yes varies the root note to give each section a different flavor. In the bass-heavy introduction D is prominent, so it sounds as if we're in the Phrygian mode; in the verse A is prominent, so it sounds as if we're in the Locrian mode; in the chorus G is prominent, so it sounds as if we're in the Aeolian mode; and for a few measures (97-102 and 122-127) C is prominent, so it sounds as if we're in the Dorian mode. That's quite the harmonic journey for such a brief song!</p>

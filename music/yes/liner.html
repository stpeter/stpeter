<h1>Fundamental Affirmation</h1>

<p>This collection was inspired by my reading of Bill Martin's book <cite>Music of Yes</cite> and conceived as something like a modern equivalent of Bach's Cello Suites. Over time, I have come to see deeper musical parallels to the six movements of a baroque suite (prelude, allemande, courante, sarabande, bourrée, gigue).</p>

<h2>To Be Over</h2>

<p>It's fitting to begin with the strains of the last, quiet notes from Chris Squire's solo album <cite>Fish Out of Water</cite>, which segue perfectly into the melody of <cite>To Be Over</cite>, one of the gentlest of Yes songs. In the free, almost improvisatory style of a prelude, I explore the contrapuntal interplay of Chris Squire's bass, Steve Howe's guitar, and Patrick Moraz's keyboards.</p>

<h2>South Side of the Sky</h2>

<p>Oftentimes, Yes music is a study in contrasts. Here we are cast from the tranquil scene of floating down a calming stream to the stark death of a group of friends in a howling mountain blizzard. In addition to echoing a traditional allemande by including heavy arpeggiation, I decided to turn the song inside out by starting with the piano interlude from the middle section and taking my time to get around to the verse.</p>

<h2>Tales from Topographic Oceans</h2>

<p>Distilling the four majestic movements of <cite>Tales from Topographic Oceans</cite> into a short suite for solo bass might seem like an impossible task, but there's a precedent: Steve Howe did it for guitar and voice on his 1993 album <cite>Not Necessarily Acoustic</cite>. Although I've chosen different themes from several of the movements, Howe's performance provided a great frame of reference for me.</p>

<h2>Turn of the Century</h2>

<p>As Chris Squire does on this beautiful song from <cite>Going For the One</cite>, I mostly follow the melody line. To emphasize the sense of lamentation in the original, I take the song at a slightly slower pace than Yes do, turning it into something of a sarabande.</p>

<h2>A Venture</h2>

<p>This song from <cite>The Yes Album</cite> is one of the hidden gems of Yes music. Although the words are somewhat serious, the music is easygoing and relaxed in the spirit of a bourrée, even verging on jazz in Steve Howe's guitar solo toward the end of the song.</p>

<h2>Close to the Edge</h2>

<p>Much Yes music is great and sublime, but <cite>Close to the Edge</cite> is perfect. Attempting to represent that perfection on a single instrument, especially one as overtly simple as the four-string bass, was a daunting task. Although I am not completely satisfied with this transcription, I did the best I could.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>Thanks to Chris Squire for opening my mind to the possibilities of the electric bass.</p>
<p>Thanks to the other members of Yes for composing the music I've arranged here.</p>
<p>Thanks to Bill Martin for suggesting the idea of Squire Variations in his book <cite>Music of Yes</cite>.</p>
<p>Thanks to Joe Veillette for creating the Minotaur bass that I play.</p>

<h2>Tech Notes</h2>

<p>The instrument is a four-string, 24-fret Minotaur bass wired with a piezo pickup at the bridge and strung with D'Addario nylon tapewound strings. Recorded direct to a System76 laptop through a Bass Buddy preamp and M-Audio USB interface using Audacity software on Ubuntu Linux.</p>

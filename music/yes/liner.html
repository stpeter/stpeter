<h1>Fundamental Affirmation</h1>

<h2>To Be Over</h2>

<p>It's fitting to begin with the strains of the last, quiet notes from Chris Squire's solo album <cite>Fish Out of Water</cite>, which seque perfectly into melody of <cite>To Be Over</cite>, one of the gentlest of Yes songs. I had a lot of fun exploring the contrapuntal interplay of Chris Squire's bass, Steve Howe's guitar, and Patrick Moraz's keyboards.</p>

<h2>South Side of the Sky</h2>

<p>Oftentimes, Yes music is a study in contrasts. Here we are cast from the tranquil scene of floating down a calming stream to the death of a group of friends in a howling mountain blizzard.  I decided to turn the song inside out by starting with the piano interlude from the middle and taking my time to get around to the verse.</p>

<h2>Turn of the Century</h2>

<p>As Chris Squire does on this beautiful song from <cite>Going For the One</cite>, I mostly follow the melody line here. To emphasize the sense of lamentation in the original, I take the song at a slightly slower pace than Yes do.</p>

<h2>Tales from Topographic Oceans</h2>

<p>Distilling the 80 minutes of <cite>Tales from Topographic Oceans</cite> into a short suite might seem like an impossible task, but there's a precedent: Steve Howe did it on his 1993 album <cite>Not Necessarily Acoustic</cite>. Although I've chosen different themes from several of the movements, Howe's performance provided a great frame of reference.</p>

<h2>A Venture</h2>

<p>

<h2>Close to the Edge</h2>

<p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>Thanks to Chris Squire for opening my mind to the possibilities of the electric bass.</p>
<p>Thanks to the other members of Yes for composing the music I've arranged here.</p>
<p>Thanks to Bill Martin for suggesting the idea of Squire Variations in his book <cite>Music of Yes</cite>.</p>
<p>Thanks to Joe Veillette for creating the Minotaur bass that I play.</p>

<h2>Tech Notes</h2>

<p>Recorded direct to a MacBook Pro through a Bass Buddy preamp and M-Audio USB interface using Audacity software. The instrument is a four-string, 24-fret Minotaur bass wired with a piezo pickup at the bridge and strung with LaBella CB40 nylon-core strings.</p>

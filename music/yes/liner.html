<h1>Fundamental Affirmation</h1>

<p>This collection of "Squire Variations" was conceived as something like a modern equivalent of Bach's Cello Suites. Over time, I have come to hear deeper musical parallels to the six movements of a baroque suite (prelude, allemande, courante, sarabande, bourrée, gigue), and I have accentuated those parallels in these arrangements.</p>

<h2>To Be Over</h2>

<p>We begin with the strains of the last, quiet notes of "Safe (Canon Song)" from Chris Squire's solo album <cite>Fish Out of Water</cite>, which segue perfectly into the melody of one of the gentlest of Yes songs: "To Be Over" from the <cite>Relayer</cite> album (1974). In the free, almost improvisatory style of a prelude, I explore the contrapuntal interplay of Chris Squire's bass, Steve Howe's guitar, and Patrick Moraz's keyboards.</p>

<h2>South Side of the Sky</h2>

<p>Oftentimes, Yes music is a study in contrasts. Here we are cast from the tranquil scene of floating down a calming stream to the stark death of a group of friends in a howling mountain blizzard. In addition to echoing a traditional allemande by including heavy arpeggiation, I decided to turn "South of the Sky" (from the 1971 release <cite>Fragile</cite>) inside out by starting with the Rick Wakeman's interlude from the middle section and taking my time to get around to the verse.</p>

<h2>Tales from Topographic Oceans</h2>

<p>Distilling the four majestic movements of 1973's double LP <cite>Tales from Topographic Oceans</cite> ("The Revealing Science of God", "The Remembering", "The Ancient", and "Ritual") into a short suite for solo bass might seem like an impossible task, but there's a precedent: Steve Howe did it for guitar and voice on his 1993 album <cite>Not Necessarily Acoustic</cite>. Although I've chosen different themes from several of the movements, Howe's performance provided a great frame of reference for me as I translated those themes to the electric bass.</p>

<h2>Turn of the Century</h2>

<p>As Chris Squire does on this haunting song from <cite>Going For The One</cite> (1977), I mostly follow the melody line. To emphasize the sense of lamentation in the original, I take the song at a slightly slower pace than Yes do, turning it into something of a sarabande.</p>

<h2>A Venture</h2>

<p>This short song from <cite>The Yes Album</cite> (recorded in late 1970) is one of the hidden gems of Yes music. Although the words are serious, the music is easygoing and relaxed in the spirit of a bourrée, even verging on jazz in Steve Howe's guitar solo toward the end of the song.</p>

<h2>Close to the Edge</h2>

<p>Much Yes music is great and sublime, but I hear perfection in the four movements of the title track of their 1972 album <cite>Close to the Edge</cite> ("The Solid Time of Change", "Total Mass Retain", "I Get Up I Get Down", and "Seasons Of Man"). Attempting to represent some fraction of that grandeur on a single instrument, especially one as simple as the four-string bass, is a daunting task. I've done the best I can.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>Thanks to Chris Squire for opening my mind to the possibilities of the electric bass. His melodic, deeply intelligent writing for the instrument will never be equalled.</p>
<p>Thanks to the other members of various Yes lineups &mdash; Jon Anderson, Steve Howe, Alan White, Bill Bruford, Rick Wakeman, Tony Kaye, and Patrick Moraz &mdash; for composing the music I've arranged here.</p>
<p>Thanks to Bill Martin for suggesting the idea of "Squire Variations" in his book <cite>Music of Yes: Structure and Vision in Progressive Rock</cite> (Open Court, 1996).</p>
<p>Thanks to Joe Veillette for creating the instrument I play: a four-string, 24-fret Minotaur bass (strung with D'Addario nylon tapewound strings).</p>

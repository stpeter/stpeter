<h2>Fundamental Affirmation</h2>
<h3>Music of Yes for Solo Electric Bass</h3>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>Ever since I first started listening to the progressive rock band <a href="http://yesworld.com/">Yes</a> in my early teens, I've been <a href='/writings/rand/rr.html'>inspired</a> by the nobility, grandeur, and deeply positive spirituality of their music. In 1999 I started <a href='/journal/65.html'>absorbing</a> and <a href='/journal/87.html'>pondering</a> their music more seriously. One of those new encounters was a reading of Bill Martin's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812693337/monadnockA">Music of Yes</a>, who suggested the idea of <a href='http://www.chrissquire.com/'>Squire</a> Variations as the foundation of extended works for solo <a href="/music/bass.html">electric bass</a> (something like a modern equivalent of the <a href="/music/bach/">Bach Cello Suites</a>). Martin's suggestion took hold in my brain as a wondrous way to pay homage to Yes music, and for the last few years I've been working on solo bass arrangements of the following Yes songs (one from each album in what Martin calls their "main sequence"):</p>
<ul>
  <li>To Be Over (from <cite>Relayer</cite>, 1974)</li>
  <li>South Side of the Sky (from <cite>Fragile</cite>, 1971)</li>
  <li>Selections from <cite>Tales from Topographic Oceans</cite> (1973)</li>
  <li>Turn of the Century (from <cite>Going For the One</cite>, 1977)</li>
  <li>A Venture (from <cite>The Yes Album</cite>, 1971)</li>
  <li>Close to the Edge (the title song from their 1972 release)</li>
</ul>
<p>So far I've completed "To Be Over" (~9 minutes), "South Side of the Sky" (~6 minutes), "Turn of the Century" (~7 minutes), "Tales from Topographic Oceans" (~13 minutes), and "A Venture" (~4 minutes). Naturally I'm saving the best for last: "Close to the Edge" (~8 minutes). I've made great progress on that recently, although I still need to figure out how to handle Rick Wakeman's huge organ solo near the end!</p>
<p>(Fans of Yes music might also be interested in an exploration of <a href='andyou.html'>And You and I</a> that I wrote some years ago.)</p>

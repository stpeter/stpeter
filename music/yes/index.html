<h2>Fundamental Affirmation</h2>
<h3>Music of Yes for Solo Bass Guitar</h3>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p><em>Last Updated: 2019-01-16</em></p>
<p>Ever since I started listening to the progressive rock band <a href="http://yesworld.com/">Yes</a> in my early teens, I've been <a href='/writings/rand/rr.html'>inspired</a> by the nobility, grandeur, and deeply positive spirituality of their music.</p>
<p>In 1999 I began to <a href='/journal/65.html'>absorb</a> and <a href='/journal/87.html'>ponder</a> their music more seriously. One of those new encounters was Bill Martin's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812693337/monadnockA">Music of Yes</a>, in which he suggests the idea of "<a href='http://www.chrissquire.com/'>Squire</a> Variations" for solo bass as a modern analogue of the <a href="/music/bach/">Bach Cello Suites</a>. Inspired by the possibilities, I've arranged the following Yes works as a suite for solo bass guitar:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href='to-be-over.html'>To Be Over</a></li>
  <li><a href='south-side-of-the-sky.html'>South Side of the Sky</a></li>
  <li><a href='tales-from-topographic-oceans.html'>Tales from Topographic Oceans</a></li>
  <li><a href='turn-of-the-century.html'>Turn of the Century</a></li>
  <li><a href='venture.html'>A Venture</a></li>
  <li>Close to the Edge</li>
</ol>
<p>As of early 2019 I've completed these arrangements, I'm capturing them in musical notation, I'm writing detailed notes about my interpretations, and I'm planning to record them in the near future. Stay tuned for updates!</p>
<p>(Fans of Yes might also enjoy a lyrical analysis of <a href='andyou.html'>And You and I</a>.)</p>

<h2>Fundamental Affirmation</h2>
<h3>Music of Yes for Solo Bass Guitar</h3>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>Last Updated: 2018-04-06</p>
<p>Ever since I started listening to the progressive rock band <a href="http://yesworld.com/">Yes</a> in my early teens, I've been <a href='/writings/rand/rr.html'>inspired</a> by the nobility, grandeur, and deeply positive spirituality of their music.</p>
<p>In 1999 I began to <a href='/journal/65.html'>absorb</a> and <a href='/journal/87.html'>ponder</a> their music more seriously. One of those new encounters was Bill Martin's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812693337/monadnockA">Music of Yes</a>, in which he suggests the idea of "<a href='http://www.chrissquire.com/'>Squire</a> Variations" for solo bass as a modern analogue of the <a href="/music/bach/">Bach Cello Suites</a>. Inspired by the possibilities, I've arranged the following Yes works for solo bass guitar (one from each album in what Martin calls their "main sequence"):</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href='to-be-over.html'>To Be Over</a></li>
  <li><a href='south-side-of-the-sky.html'>South Side of the Sky</a></li>
  <li>Tales from Topographic Oceans</li>
  <li>Turn of the Century (<a href='Turn-Of-The-Century.pdf'>sheet music</a>)</li>
  <li>A Venture (<a href='A-Venture.pdf'>sheet music</a>)</li>
  <li>Close to the Edge</li>
</ul>
<p>As of early 2018 I've completed these arrangements, I'm capturing them in musical notation, I'm writing detailed notes about my interpretations, and I plan to record them by the end of the year. Stay tuned for updates!</p>
<p>(Fans of Yes music might also be interested in an exploration of <a href='andyou.html'>And You and I</a> that I wrote some years ago.)</p>

<h2>Fundamental Affirmation</h2>
<h3>Music of Yes for Solo Electric Bass</h3>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>Ever since I started listening to the progressive rock band <a href="http://yesworld.com/">Yes</a> in my early teens, I've been <a href='/writings/rand/rr.html'>inspired</a> by the nobility, grandeur, and deeply positive spirituality of their music.</p>
<p>In 1999 I began to <a href='/journal/65.html'>absorb</a> and <a href='/journal/87.html'>ponder</a> their music more seriously. One of those new encounters was Bill Martin's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812693337/monadnockA">Music of Yes</a>, in which he suggests the idea of "<a href='http://www.chrissquire.com/'>Squire</a> Variations" as a modern equivalent of the <a href="/music/bach/">Bach Cello Suites</a>. Inspired by the possibilities, I've arranged the following Yes works for solo <a href="/music/bass.html">electric bass</a> (one from each album in what Martin calls their "main sequence"):</p>
<ul>
  <li>To Be Over (from <cite>Relayer</cite>, 1974), ~8 minutes</li>
  <li>South Side of the Sky (from <cite>Fragile</cite>, 1971), ~5 minutes</li>
  <li><cite>Tales from Topographic Oceans</cite> (1973), ~13 minutes</li>
  <li>Turn of the Century (from <cite>Going For the One</cite>, 1977), ~7 minutes</li>
  <li>A Venture (from <cite>The Yes Album</cite>, 1971), ~4 minutes</li>
  <li>Close to the Edge (from their eponymous 1972 album), ~8 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>Although I've completed these arrangements and even written some <a href='liner.html'>liner notes</a>, I still need to figure out how to handle Rick Wakeman's huge organ solo near the end of "Close to the Edge"!</p>
<p>(Fans of Yes music might also be interested in an exploration of <a href='andyou.html'>And You and I</a> that I wrote some years ago.)</p>

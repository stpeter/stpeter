<h1>SaintSongs: The Music of Peter Saint-Andre</h1>
<p>I've been playing guitar, singing songs, and writing music for a long time. The music I create comes in three varieties under numerous <a href='influences.html'>influences</a>: acoustic singer-songwriter fare, extended pieces for solo classical guitar with new-age overtones, and arrangements for solo <a href='bass.html'>electric bass</a>.</p>
<p>My primary projects are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/music/yes/">Fundamental Affirmation</a> &#151; arrangements for solo bass guitar of songs by the progressive rock band Yes (recording slated to begin in 2018)</li>
<li><a href="/music/aubade/">Aubade</a> &#151; three suites and a set of variations for solo classical guitar</li>
<li><a href="/music/plow/">Freedom's Plow</a> &#151; a musical setting of Langston Hughes's long poem about America and freedom</li>
<li><a href="/music/hagiography/">Hagiography</a> &#151; a suite of original songs about life and love</li>
<li><a href="/music/dylan/">RAZ</a> &#151; covers of some songs by Bob Dylan</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually I hope to also work on solo bass arrangements of music by <a href="/music/rush/">Rush</a> and perhaps even a recording of <a href="/music/bach/">Bach's Cello Suites</a> on bass guitar.</p>
<p>And here's a bit of information about the <a href='instruments.html'>instruments</a> I play.</p>

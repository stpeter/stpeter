<h2>Pre-Emptive Strike</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>
I know you're safe but are you sound<br />
I know you're lost but have you found<br />
A way to live that's not so narrow<br />
A bow that can restrain the arrow<br />
You load and aim at your own soul<br />
The blow you strike against your goal
</p>
<p>
It's happiness that cannot be<br />
While you refuse the path that's free<br />
Not free from payment, challenge, strife<br />
But free for living your only life<br />
Your only life, there's none above<br />
It's here that you must show your love
</p>
<p>
Show your love <br />
Of what you feel and know to be your goal<br />
Know your goal<br />
Is something hidden deep within your soul<br />
In your soul<br />
There's life and love that you have long denied<br />
You've denied<br />
The sacred fire that only you can hide<br />
You can't hide
</p>
<p>
The hardest fight is not to win<br />
It's warding off the only sin<br />
Not giving in to others' might<br />
But giving up your own true sight<br />
Of what you can and cannot be<br />
Of what you have inside that's free
</p>
<p>
Show your love <br />
Of what you feel and know to be your goal<br />
Know your goal<br />
Is something hidden deep within your soul<br />
In your soul<br />
There's life and love that you have long denied<br />
You've denied<br />
The sacred fire that only you can hide<br />
You can't hide
</p>

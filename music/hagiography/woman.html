<h2>You Are Woman</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>
You know it was so long that I was lonely,<br />
Wondering if I'd ever find<br />
A love that could match my passion inside<br />
But that all seems so far away now,<br />
Now that I've seen deep in your eyes <br />
A spirit with life to match mine
</p>
<p>
I've finally found the woman I needed all along<br />
All along the long, lonely years<br />
I look out and see that all I believe is fully real<br />
Because to me, you are woman
</p>
<p>
You know it feels so right that I should trust you<br />
With all of my mind and all of my soul <br />
And all of this passion for life that you know<br />
Can it be somehow I've known you forever?<br />
Two of a kind one soul and mind <br />
I know you're my kindred spirit
</p>
<p>
There's the love that you show when you give your heart away<br />
And then there's the love that you cherish inside<br />
But I never felt that outside and in my love was one<br />
Until I found you, my woman
</p>
<p>
You awaken all that lies within me<br />
All I can do, all that I see,<br />
All that I am and know I can be<br />
I've never felt this kind of inspiration<br />
Filling me up giving me life<br />
Feeding the fire within my soul
</p>
<p>
Was longing to find a woman in kind but not the same<br />
A soul to complete me in every way<br />
To make my life whole there's only one thing that's left to do<br />
And that's to make you my woman
</p>

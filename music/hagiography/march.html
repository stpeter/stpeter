<h2>March</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>
In like a lion, out like a lamb<br />
That's how our love has been<br />
Storm and passion, sky of fire<br />
Howling wind and cry of lyre<br />
Signifying nothing but the future green<br />
Of something more than what might have been<br />
Of something more than the present sham
</p>
<p>
Some there are who celebrate spring<br />
They love its promise and the things it will bring<br />
But they forget how inconstant the spring can be<br />
And that becoming is not yet to be<br />
And February's lonesome beauty<br />
Its cloudless skies and sun reflected low<br />
From furrowed fields and dunes of snow<br />
Blinding eyes but inspiring soul
</p>
<p>
March is a mess<br />
A necessary experiment<br />
Thankful it came, thankful it went<br />
A necessary experiment<br />
The season of mud and wading<br />
Waiting for open fields and lakes<br />
Snow and ice receding I'd surmise<br />
At the glacial pace of love's demise
</p>
<p>
April showers bring May flowers<br />
What do May flowers bring?<br />
April showers bring May flowers<br />
What do May flowers bring?

<h2>Heaven Sent</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>
Darling, where'd you come from?<br />
Darling, where'd you come from?<br />
I came to love you, I came to bring you joy<br />
Bring you joy<br />
Bring you joy
</p>
<p>
I'll bring the love and joy you have earned and deserved,<br />
the bliss you've never tasted<br />
I'll make up for the years of your love you have lost,
<br />your sense of passion wasted<br />
We'll go to heights on this earth where darling you never went<br />
I'll mean to you in your life what no man ever meant
</p>
<p>
You ask: Where'd you come from, darling, where'd you come from?<br />
I say: heaven sent.
</p>
<p>
Darling, where'd you come from?<br />
Darling, where'd you come from?<br />
I came to love you, I came to bring you joy<br />
Bring you joy<br />
Bring you joy
</p>

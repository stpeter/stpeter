<h2>Gatekeeper Blues</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>
They call me Saint Peter<br />
'Cause you know I got the keys<br />
They call me Saint Peter<br />
'Cause you know I got the keys<br />
And I will let you into heaven<br />
Anytime that you please
</p>
<p>
Keep one eye on Saint Peter<br />
'Cause he's got all his eyes on you<br />
Look over your shoulder<br />
Be on your best behavior<br />
Watch out<br />
'Cause he's a-watching you<br />
Be good for Saint Peter and he'll be good to you
</p>
<p>
If you want to go to heaven<br />
I'm the man you gotta use<br />
If you want to go to heaven<br />
I'm the man you gotta use<BR>
But if I don't see your face 'round my pearly gates,<BR>
I'll have those gatekeeper blues 
</p>
<p>
They call me Saint Peter<br />
'Cause you know I got the keys<br />
All the girls call me Saint Peter<br />
'Cause they all know I got the keys<br />
But I will take you to heaven<br />
Anytime that you please

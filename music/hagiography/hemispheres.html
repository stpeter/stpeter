<h2>Aristophanic Hemispheres</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>
I needed you way before I even knew about<br />
The things I felt and thought inside<br />
I need you in ways I never could have known about<br />
Until I felt this love inside<br />
They say that to think in your mind<br />
Is the talk of your soul<br />
All alone with itself apart<br />
But I know that talking with you<br />
It's one soul and one mind<br />
That can think in two places at once
</p>
<p>
We're two hemipsheres<br />
Need the other half to survive<br />
We're a perfect sphere<br />
With you I feel so alive
</p>
<p>
But when we're apart there's this pressure inside me<br />
Like my spirit needs to fly away to you<br />
And when you're near I'm at peace inside<br />
Because my spirit knows with you it is fulfilled<br />
And when we're close all I want in the world<br />
Is to be at one with you<br />
And when we're one in every way I'm complete<br />
And I live one life with you
</p>
<p>
We're two hemispheres<br />
Need the other half to survive<br />
We're a perfect sphere<br />
With you I feel so alive
</p>
<p>
I want to touch the surface of my other half<br />
And explore the way it fits so well<br />
I want to live this sacred joy I feel with you<br />
I want to celebrate our seamless shell
</p>
<p>
We're two hemispheres<br />
Need the other half to survive<br />
We're a perfect sphere<br />
With you I feel so alive
</p>
<p>
I need you like the sky needs the sun<br />
Like the sun needs the earth<br />
Like the earth needs the rain<br />
Like the rain needs the cloud <br />
Like the cloud needs the air<br />
Like the air needs the plant<br />
Like the plant needs the ground to survive
</p>
<p>
I need you to survive

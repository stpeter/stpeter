<h2>Center of the World</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>
Well, the world it's got a center<br />
And that's why it keeps revolving<br />
And you know that it's the healthy ones<br />
Who strive and keep evolving<br />
But the lonely ones and only ones<br />
Don't realize the dangers<br />
Of entrusting all their self-respect<br />
To friends they know are strangers
</p>
<p>
Well, you think that you're the center<br />
And the focus of attention<br />
But you're afraid to see the naked truth<br />
That no one dares to mention<br />
Your emptiness surrounds you<br />
In the arms of its embrace<br />
And your innocent's white aura<br />
Hides the pain behind your face
</p>
<p>
But I know it's there<br />
And I know you care<br />
About the gaze, about the stare<br />
Of those who see what's really there<br />
And I know your tears<br />
Yes I know your fears<br />
The tears from fleeing life unfurled<br />
The fear you're not the center of the world
</p>
<p>
Well, the world it's got a center<br />
And that's how it stays so stable<br />
And I hope that you will find your center<br />
While you still are able<br />
Instead of spending all your days<br />
In sadness and confusion<br />
Discovering too late<br />
There is no joy in your illusion
</p>
<p>
But I know it's there<br />
And I know you care<br />
About the passion life can bring<br />
About the kind of love I sing<br />
And I know your dreams<br />
Yes I know it seems<br />
Ideals and dreams are far from true<br />
But if you live them they'll be real for you
</p>

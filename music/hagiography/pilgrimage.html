<h2>Pilgrimage</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<h4>Part I: The Rain</h4>
<p>(Instrumental)</p>
<h4>Part II: Long Division</h4>
<p>
Do you recall our long division?<br />
Three by two leaves one<br />
Three: that's our devotion<br />
Two: that's our division<br />
One: that's my decision
</p>
<p>
But talk of mathematics<br />
Sounds so cold and dry<br />
Probability and statistics<br />
Are always used to lie
</p>
<p>
Three: the love we created<br />
Two: the split that was fated<br />
One: the changes that made each alone
</p>
<p>
Do you recall our long division?<br />
Three by two leaves one<br />
Three: that's our devotion<br />
Two: that's our division<br />
One: that's my decision
</p>
<p>
But talk of mathematics<br />
Sounds so cold and dry<br />
Probability and statistics<br />
Are always used to lie
</p>
<h4>Part III: I Remain (a Pilgrim)</h4>
<p>
I always was a pilgrim, and that's what I remain.<br />
The old world was so inhospitable<br />
to my religion and belief<br />
that there's no point in labored grief<br />
over continents lost while I'm able<br />
to seek anew and set the table<br />
of friendship before I dine on love.
</p>
<p>
So I'll seek again a real good place<br />
(utopia to some) for landing smooth,<br />
where I can be at home on earth<br />
as once I was, as once I was.<br />
As once I was -- see it in the face<br />
of the joyous boy before he's hurt,<br />
crushed in by the alien belief <br />
that no man should ever feel that deep.
</p>
<p>
A pilgrim, yes, but hold the grim --<br />
not conquering forests in the wild,<br />
but finding what's never lost inside:<br />
the wide-open, wise, and curious child<br />
who seeks to know all that he's felt <br />
and holds within himself an untouched truth:<br />
the noble soul itself reveres,<br />
the noble soul itself reveres.

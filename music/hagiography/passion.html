<h2>Passion</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>
People tell me, why don't you have a job?<br />
My friends ask me, hey now where's your steady job?<br />
I tell 'em I'm scraping by I'm doing fine <br />
And what's it matter if I don't have a job?
</p>
<p>
Well, I ran into Julio down on the street he said <br />
Whatever happened to that girl you used to know?<br />
Well, I ran into Julio he said where's that girl you used to know?<br />
I said how could I love her right when the passion it was low?
</p>
<p>
Ain't got no house, ain't got no car, ain't got no stereo,<br />
Don't want no drugs to smoke to pick me up when I am low,<br />
Ain't got no girl to make want to sing and make me shout,<br />
But right now I don't care because I know what life's about<br />
'Cause I got passion, I got passion.
</p>

<h2>Topology</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>
Some folks say love is chemistry<br />
And others say it's biology<br />
Magnetism, electricity<br />
But they don't know about you and me<br />
'Cause our love it ain't none of above<br />
No our love is topology
</p>
<p>
Electric currents, magnetic fields<br />
They don't describe just how I feel<br />
Strong force, weak force, molecular bonds<br />
Pebbles making waves when they're thrown in ponds<br />
No we fit together like a hand in a glove<br />
'Cause ours is a topological love
</p>
<p>
I don't mean to intellectualize<br />
Something as simple as proportionate size<br />
But the woman I'm a-loving she's a size and height<br />
You know she suits me so well that it just feels right<br />
'Cause I fit her and she fits me<br />
And that's why it's topology
</p>

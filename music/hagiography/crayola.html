<h2>Emotional Crayola</h2>

<p>
Well I started with a piece of paper<br />
And a pencil in my hand<br />
And I waded into representing<br />
As I saw it the lay of the land<br />
But the tools I was using and ideas I was abusing<br />
They were only black and white<br />
And with only two colors in my picture of life<br />
Well it sure wasn't much of a sight
</p>
<p>
But then I found myself a box of crayons<br />
And I started coloring in<br />
Tooling through and erasing outlines<br />
Just as sure as I'd pencilled 'em in<br />
Got rid of them borders between me and other people<br />
And I thought it made things pretty clear<br />
But with only eight crayons in my starter set<br />
Well you know I came a little too near
</p>
<p>
To throwing my life away<br />
On a picture'd never be complete<br />
Being limited and burned by the knowledge<br />
And the wisdom I'd just happened to meet<br />
Restricting my vision and making my decisions<br />
With an eight-color view of life<br />
Well I thought that I was ready<br />
But my reason it was steady<br />
So I hit the store looking for more<br />
Emotional Crayolas
</p>
<p>
But then I found myself a bigger box of crayons<br />
You know it must have been a twenty-four<br />
And I started seeing colors in the picture<br />
That I never could have seen before<br />
Right then right there I was ready<br />
To be painting for the rest of my life<br />
Creating picture after picture<br />
In a situation that was full of strife
</p>
<p>
Throwing my life away<br />
On a picture'd never be complete<br />
Being limited and burned by the knowledge<br />
And the wisdom I'd just happened to meet<br />
Restricting my vision and making my decisions<br />
With a twenty-color view of life<br />
Well I thought that I was ready<br />
But my reason it was steady<br />
So I hit the store looking for more<br />
Emotional Crayolas
</p>
<p>
But now I know that I've got myself the biggest<br />
Set of crayons time and money can buy<br />
I'm seeing colors like sepias and umbers<br />
Well darling you know it ain't no lie<br />
When I say this is the way<br />
That I'd hoped the picture'd look<br />
From way before I'd even started to draw<br />
But in the glory that I'm seeing<br />
And the joy in my being<br />
There's a rapture that I never foresaw 
</p>
<p>
While I was throwing my life away<br />
On a picture'd never be complete<br />
Being limited and burned by the knowledge<br />
And the wisdom I'd just happened to meet<br />
Restricting my vision and making my decisions<br />
With a double-digit view of life<br />
Well I thought that I was living<br />
But the colors that you're giving<br />
Make me see what I was missing before<br />

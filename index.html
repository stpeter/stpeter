<h1>Peter Saint-Andre</h1>
<p>Welcome to my home on the web! (And note that I more frequently update my <a href='/journal/'>online journal</a> and post to <a href='https://twitter.com/stpeter'>Twitter</a>.)</p>
<p>I'm a <a href='/tech/'>technologist</a>, best known for my work on <a href='http://xmpp.org/'>XMPP</a> (a.k.a. Jabber), an open Internet standard for instant messaging, presence, and real-time collaboration. I've also worked on identity, security, internationalization, and related topics. In March 2012 I completed a two-year term on the <a href='http://www.ietf.org/iesg/'>IESG</a> as co-director of the Applications Area at the <a href='http://www.ietf.org/'>IETF</a>. In my spare time, I run <a href='http://www.jabber.org/'>jabber.org</a> and <a href='http://xmpp.net/'>xmpp.net</a> and even do a bit of programming now and then.</p>
<p>I'm a <a href='/writings/'>writer</a>, having authored <a href='http://tao-of-roark.com/'>The Tao of Roark</a>, a dictionary of philosophy entitled <a href='http://ismbook.com/'>The Ism Book</a>, a book of essays entitled <a href='/writings/rand/'>Randian Reflections</a>, a book of poems entitled <a href='/writings/fire/'>Ancient Fire</a>, translations of <a href='http://www.monadnock.net/sappho/'>Sappho</a>, <a href='http://www.monadnock.net/horace/'>Horace</a>, and <a href='http://www.monadnock.net/epicurus/'>Epicurus</a>, and most recently an Epicurean <a href='/writings/epicurus/'>dialogue on happiness</a>.</p>
<p>I'm a <a href='/music/'>musician</a>, having written a few dozen <a href='/music/hagiography/'>songs</a>, composed four extended works for <a href='/music/aubade/'>solo classical guitar</a>, set to music the Langston Hughes poem <a href='/music/plow/'>Freedom's Plow</a>, and arranged some songs by the <a href='/music/yes/'>progressive rock band Yes</a> for solo electric bass. After I record all that, I plan to work on solo bass recordings of songs by the rock band Rush, works by jazz composer Duke Ellington, and the Cello Suites by J.S. Bach.</p>
<p>I'm an advocate for free culture, having republished numerous public domain texts at <a href='http://www.monadnock.net/'>The Monadnock Press</a> and written the essays <a href='/writings/essays/publicdomain.html'>Who's Afraid of the Public Domain?</a> and <a href='/writings/essays/whatiscopyright.html'>What Is Copyright?</a>. Everything on my websites is covered under the <a href='http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'>CC0 Public Domain Dedication</a> unless expressly labelled otherwise.</p>
<p>I'm a student of philosophy. My favorite thinkers are Lao Tzu, Heraclitus, Aristotle, Epicurus, the gnostic Jesus, Abelard, William of Ockham, Spinoza, Thoreau, Nietzsche, Lin Yutang, Ayn Rand, and Hao Wang.</p>
<p>I'm a lover of the arts. My favorite painters are Jan Vermeer and Joaquin Sorolla. My favorite sculptors are Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Daniel Chester French. My favorite playwrights are Sophocles, Shakespeare, and Ibsen. My favorite novelists are Victor Hugo, Yevgeny Zamyatin, and Ayn Rand. My favorite poets are Sappho, Horace, Andrew Marvell, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, A.E. Housman, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Langston Hughes, and Timothy Steele. My favorite composers are J.S. Bach and Duke Ellington, followed by Chopin, Dvořák, Albéniz, and Granados. My favorite musicians are Glenn Gould, Julian Bream, Stephen Isserlis, Patricia McCarty, Andras Schiff, Alicia De Larrocha, Earl Hines, Joe Pass, Ella Fitzgerald, Keith Jarrett, Marcus Roberts, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, George Winston, Kristina Welling, Michael Hedges, Fairport Convention, Renaissance, Rush, and especially Yes.</p>
<p>I'm a vibrant loner, a gregarious misanthrope, a poetic geek, a cerebral musician, a practical philosopher, a spiritual non-believer, a progressive libertarian, a secular conservative, a free-market liberal, a rational patriot, an inhabitant and admirer of America and the Anglosphere and Western Civilization.</p>

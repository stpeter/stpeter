<h1>Peter Saint-Andre: Kaufmann Translations</h1>
<p>One of my favorite poets is Walter Kaufmann, who is best known for his magisterial translations of the works of Nietzsche, but whose poems I've read with pleasure over the years. In addition to many fine poems in English, Kaufmann wrote ten poems in German in the period 1939-1942, which to my knowledge have not been translated into English. Since few people know of Kaufmann as a poet and even fewer still are probably interested in rendering his German poems into English, I thought I would try my hand at the daunting task of translating the translator.</p>

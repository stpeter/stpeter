<h2>"The Fleeting Years"</h2>
<h3>(Horace, Odes II.14)</h3>
<h4>translated by Peter Saint-Andre</h4>
<p>
Alas, Postumus, the fleeting years<br />
fall away, nor will piety cause<br />
delay to wrinkles or advancing<br />
old age or indomitable death.
</p>
<p>
Even if you sacrificed a bull<br />
each day you couldn't placate tearless<br />
Pluto, who with his waves imprisons<br />
thrice-strong Geryon and Tityos --
</p>
<p>
and those waves, my friend, must needs be crossed<br />
by all who feed on the earth's bounty<br />
whether we're kings or wretched peasants.<br />
In vain we'll try to avoid cruel Mars
</p>
<p>
and the inconstant disturbances<br />
that course the roaring Adriatic --<br />
in vain through the autumn will we fear<br />
the south wind, harmful to our bodies.
</p>
<p>
We must see the wandering, sluggish<br />
Cocytos -- the infamous offspring<br />
of Danaus -- the son of Aeolus:<br />
Sisyphus damned to his ceaseless toil;
</p>
<p>
we must leave behind the earth and home<br />
and pleasing spouse, and none of those trees<br />
you tend will follow you, its short-lived<br />
master, except the hated cypress.
</p>
<p>
A worthier heir will drink the wine<br />
you guard now with a hundred keys: he'll<br />
drench the pavement with your best -- more fine<br />
than that on which the highest priests do feast.
</p>

<h2>"The Fleeting Years"</h2>
<h3>(Horace, Odes II.14)</h3>
<h4>translated by Peter Saint-Andre</h4>
<p>
Alas, Postumus, the fleeting years<br />
Fall away, nor will piety cause<br />
Delay to wrinkles or advancing<br />
Old age or indomitable death.
</p>
<p>
Even if you sacrificed a bull<br />
Each day you couldn't placate tearless<br />
Pluto, who with his waves imprisons<br />
Thrice-strong Geryon and Tityos &mdash;
</p>
<p>
And those waves, my friend, must needs be crossed<br />
By all who feed on the earth's bounty,<br />
Whether we're kings or wretched peasants.<br />
In vain we'll try to avoid cruel Mars
</p>
<p>
And the inconstant disturbances<br />
That course the roaring Adriatic &mdash;<br />
In vain through the autumn will we fear<br />
The south wind, harmful to our bodies.
</p>
<p>
We must see the wandering, sluggish<br />
Cocytos &mdash; the infamous offspring<br />
Of Danaus &mdash; the son of Aeolus:<br />
Sisyphus damned to his ceaseless toil.
</p>
<p>
We must leave behind the earth and home<br />
And pleasing spouse, and none of those trees<br />
You tend will follow you, its short-lived<br />
Master, except the hated cypress.
</p>
<p>
A worthier heir will drink the wine<br />
You guard now with a hundred keys: he'll<br />
Drench the pavement with your best &mdash; more fine<br />
Than that on which the highest priests do feast.
</p>

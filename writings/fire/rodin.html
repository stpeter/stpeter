<h2>On a Visit to the Mus√©e Rodin</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>
Although I know no French, the usher's glare is universal:<br />
"Look but do not touch." Yet can one know the passion of the kiss<br />
Just by looking? The eyes aren't enough; neither are the hands.<br />
</p>
<p>
I need no reminder, yet here it is: in comes a girl,<br />
Stark blind, her family leading her from room to room. I watch&nbsp;&mdash;<br />
Roiled by envy, wakened by pity, held by fascination.
</p>
<p>
Her gentle warm hands move slowly over the cold unmoving<br />
Marble, changed brusquely by its maker from unfeeling stone<br />
To these violent images of longing, love, living passion.
</p>
<p>
In her darkness she has a way to know that's not allowed<br />
To me. I sneak a touch while the usher's turned but it is<br />
As nothing to her caress. Once again, authorities
</p>
<p>
Enforce the dualism of eye and hand. Why can't we join<br />
The light of sight and touch? It's what we need so we can gain<br />
An understanding of the kind that does not end at stone.
</p>

<h2>On a Visit to the Mus&#233;e Rodin</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>
Although I know no French, the usher's glare is universal:<br />
"Look but do not touch." Yet can one know the passion of the kiss<br />
Just by looking? The eyes are not enough; and neither are the hands.<br />
I require no reminder, yet here it is: in comes a girl,<br />
Stark blind, her family leading her from room to room as I watch &mdash;<br />
Roiled by envy, wakened by pity, held by fascination.<br />
Her gentle warm hands move slowly over the cold unmoving<br />
Marble, changed brusquely by its maker from unfeeling stone to<br />
These violent images of longing, love, and living passion.<br />
In her darkness she holds a way of knowing that's not allowed<br />
To me. I sneak a touch while the usher is turned but it is as<br />
Nothing to her loving caress. Once again, authorities<br />
Enforce the dualism of eye and hand. Why can we not join<br />
The understanding of sight and touch? It's what we need so we can feel<br />
As much as we would feel, and live in light that does not end at stone.

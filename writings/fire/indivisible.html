<h2>Indivisible</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>
Imagine if you were a number:<br />
Which would you choose to be?<br />
Something firm and solid, like two,<br />
Or something odd, like three?
</p>
<p>
Zero would be numeric slumber,<br />
The life of <em>i</em>, complex;<br />
The air of million might entice you,<br />
Or largest googolplex.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps you'd be the one and only,<br />
Lost in self-absorption;<br />
Perhaps forsake the whole adventure,<br />
Only be a portion.
</p>
<p>
I'd risk a life that might be lonely,<br />
But mine in all its time:<br />
I'd open myself up to censure<br />
And choose to be a prime.
</p>

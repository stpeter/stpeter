<h2>"What Shall a Singer Ask of Apollo?"</h2>
<h3>(Horace, Odes I.31)</h3>
<h4>translated by Peter Saint-Andre</h4>
<p>
What shall a singer ask of Apollo<br/>
While pouring wine from the offering bowl?<br/>
Not the fertile cornfields of rich Sardinia;<br />
Not the finest herds of hot Calabria;<br/>
Not gold or ivory from far India;<br/>
Not the land that's washed away by gentle<br />
Waters from the quiet-flowing Liris.<br/>
Let those whom Fate has assigned prune the vines<Br/>
With Calenian scythes so that some rich<br/>
Merchant may drink deeply, from golden cups,<br />
The wine for which he trades Syrian goods<br />
(He's dear to the gods, for three times a year<br />
He ventures on the Atlantic, unscathed) &mdash; <br />
<em>My</em> feast is olives, chicory, mallows.<br/>
Grant me my health, I pray, let me enjoy<br />
What I have and pass old age with a sound<br />
Mind, with honor, and with my cithara.

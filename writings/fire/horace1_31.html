<h2>"What Shall a Singer Ask of Apollo?"</h2>
<h3>(Horace, Odes I.31)</h3>
<h4>translated by Peter Saint-Andre</h4>
<p>What shall a singer ask<br />
Of Apollo? What shall<br />
He request, pouring wine<br />
From the offering bowl?
</p>
<p>
Not the fertile cornfields<br />
Of rich Sardinia;<br />
Not the fine herds of hot<br />
Calabria; not gold<br />
Or ivory from far<br />
India; not the land<br />
That's washed away by the<br />
Gentle waters of the<br />
Quiet-flowing Liris.
</p>
<p>
Let those whom Fate assigns<br />
Prune the vines with scythes from<br />
Calenia, so that<br />
Some rich merchant may drink<br />
Deeply, from golden cups,<br />
The wine for which he trades<br />
Syrian merchandise<br />
(He is dear to the gods,<br />
For three or four times each<br />
Year he ventures out on<br />
The Atlantic, unscathed) &mdash; <br />
<em>My</em> feast shall be olives,<br />
Chicory, and mallows.
</p>
<p>
Grant me health, I pray, and<br />
To enjoy what I have:<br />
To pass my old age with<br />
A sound mind, with honor,<br />
And with my cithara.
</p>

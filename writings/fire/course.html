<h2>The Course of the Sun</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>
How high, we ask, has the sun yet climbed?<br />
We wonder, hope, but do not know.<br />
No other star we can see so shines,<br />
And yet perhaps it's only show.
</p>
<p>
It can seem our star has risen far<br />
At some times and in some respects;<br />
But then past glory or future hope<br />
Becomes all that our world reflects.
</p>
<p>
Except the troubled ascent of man<br />
The world's not seen a star like this,<br />
That rises, and falls, to rise again&nbsp;&mdash;<br />
Abyss to bliss to precipice.
</p>
<p>
Yet looking closely the mind discerns<br />
That, even when our sun grows dark,<br />
In the molten core a fire burns,<br />
Ignited by an ageless spark.
</p>

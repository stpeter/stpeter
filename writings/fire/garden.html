<h2>In the Garden</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p><em>Encampment River Trail, May 27th, 2000</em></p>
<p>
In the garden of my life<br />
I'm done with envy, done with strife.<br />
I cultivate my natural joys<br />
Far from this culture's fearful noise.
</p>
<p>
Congress hall and marketplace,<br />
Fame's small change and honor's race,<br />
Academe's cold, haughty tower &mdash;<br />
Have no meaning, hold no power.
</p>
<p>
Letting go of shoulds and oughts,<br />
I concentrate on greener thoughts<br />
And find as I fulfill my soul<br />
That things spin calmly in control &mdash;
</p>
<p>
That though events conspire still,<br />
They tend to bend toward my will.<br />
No greater cause achieves the measure<br />
Than that of my own reasoned pleasure.
</p>

<h1>Moving Violation</h1>
<h2>by Peter Saint-Andre</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
When I heard the news, I practically choked:<br />
My poetic license had been revoked!<br />
It seems that the Central Poetry Board<br />
Decided it was over me they'd lord<br />
By taking away my avocation,<br />
From which I gain no remuneration.
</p>
<p>
I found their reasoning convoluted,<br />
They found my reaction less than muted:<br />
I vowed not to go from better to worse<br />
By writing any of their fine free verse!<br />
I'll take my metrical lines underground<br />
Before I make verse without sense or sound.
</p>
<p>
But worst was the "crime" that incited this measure:<br />
They claimed I'd been giving my audience pleasure!

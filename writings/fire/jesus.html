<h2>Jesus in Atlantis</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>
I never claimed to be the Christ,<br />
the son of God, the savior of man,<br />
a worker of wonders,<br />
the ender of plunder --<br />
martyred and anointed,<br />
divinely appointed<br />
to cleanse all living men of sin.
</p>
<p>
Such sin I did not recognize:<br />
violations of long-dead rules.<br />
I brooked no division,<br />
no unnatural fission;<br />
I sought one congregation,<br />
one fellowship of nations,<br />
one home on earth for all to live in.
</p>
<p>
Upon my death they brought me here:<br />
the home of heroes, not of saints.<br />
At first I didn't understand<br />
why this was my final land,<br />
why my death upon a cross<br />
was a world entire's loss,<br />
how sweet the fruits were of my search.
</p>
<p>
Only slowly did I come to see<br />
the meaning of my too-brief life:<br />
why some I taught did shun<br />
the man to make god's son,<br />
and why they lost their way<br />
in a crowd of gods and strayed<br />
from simple truths to build a church.
</p>
<p>
Now every year brings fresh reports<br />
of violence done (and in my name!)<br />
to what I held divine:<br />
the heart and soul and mind<br />
of each sacred living man --<br />
not the so-called higher plans<br />
of gods above and kings below.
</p>
<p>
I never lusted for the power<br />
that kings and gods and rulers hold;<br />
I wanted only to teach,<br />
not really even to preach,<br />
to live with those who'd share<br />
my way of being, bare<br />
of pretense, falseness, show.
</p>
<p>
Oh would that I could intervene<br />
and live with men a second time,<br />
just as some have prophesied:<br />
straighten out my legacy<br />
(though not as they imagine)<br />
and wipe away the sin<br />
that lies deep on my land of birth.
</p>
<p>
For Christians with their hundred sects,<br />
and even their many heretics,<br />
came to love authority<br />
of the kind that murdered me, <br />
lost their love for that thing --<br />
the human soul -- that brings<br />
good will to men and peace on earth.

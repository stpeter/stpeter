<h2>Jesus in Atlantis</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>
I never claimed to be the Christ,<br />
The son of God, savior of man,<br />
A worker of wonders,<br />
The ender of plunder&nbsp;&mdash;<br />
Martyred and anointed,<br />
Divinely appointed<br />
To cleanse all living men of sin.
</p>
<p>
Such sin I did not recognize:<br />
Violations of long-dead rules.<br />
I brooked no division,<br />
No unnatural fission;<br />
I sought one congregation,<br />
One fellowship of nations,<br />
One home on earth for all to live in.
</p>
<p>
Upon my death they brought me here:<br />
The home of heroes, not of saints.<br />
At first I didn't understand<br />
Just why this was my final land,<br />
Or why my death upon a cross<br />
Had been a world entire's loss,<br />
How sweet the fruits were of my search.
</p>
<p>
Slowly, slowly I came to see<br />
The meaning of my too-brief life:<br />
Why some of those I taught did shun<br />
The man I was to make god's son,<br />
And why it was they lost their way<br />
Amidst a crowd of gods and strayed<br />
From simple truths to build a church.
</p>
<p>
Now every year brings fresh reports<br />
Of violence done (and in my name!)<br />
To what I held divine:<br />
The heart and soul and mind<br />
Of every sacred living man&nbsp;&mdash;<br />
And not the so-called higher plans<br />
Of gods above and kings below.
</p>
<p>
I never lusted for the power<br />
That kings and gods and rulers hold;<br />
I wanted but to teach,<br />
Not even quite to preach,<br />
To live with those who'd share<br />
My way of being, bare<br />
Of pretense, falseness, envy, show.
</p>
<p>
Oh would that I could intervene<br />
And live with men a second time,<br />
As some think is prophesy:<br />
I'd straighten out my legacy&nbsp;&mdash;<br />
Although not as they imagine&nbsp;&mdash;<br />
For I would wipe away the sin<br />
That lies deep on my land of birth.
</p>
<p>
The Christians with their hundred sects,<br />
Even their many heretics,<br />
Came to love authority<br />
Of the kind that murdered me, <br />
Lost their love for that thing&nbsp;&mdash;<br />
The human soul &mdash; that brings<br />
Good will to men and peace on earth.

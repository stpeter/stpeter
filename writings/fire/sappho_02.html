<h2>Come Here to Me from crete"</h2>
<h3>(Sappho, Fragment 2)</h3>
<h4>translated by Peter Saint-Andre</h4>
<p>
Come here to me from Crete, to your temple,<br />
Where stands your lovely grove of apple trees,<br />
Where holy altars smoke with frankincense;
</p>
<p>
Here cold water sounds through apple branches,<br />
The ground is all carpeted with roses,<br />
Enchanted sleep falls from shimmering leaves;
</p>
<p>
Here the field that's grazed by horses is lush<br />
With spring flowers, here the winds sweetly blow<br/>
[...]
</p>
<p>
Here, O goddess, so gracefully you grasp<br />
The golden cup, freely pouring like wine<br/>
The nectar all-mixed with our rejoicing.
</p>

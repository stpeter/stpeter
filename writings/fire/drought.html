<h2>Drought</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>
Acorn-pummeled, the house withstands<br />
The hail of overhanging oaks,<br />
Whose outstretched arms had once stood guard,<br />
Whose dried-up fruit lies deep now on the yard.
</p>
<p>
Likewise, the verdure of the lawn<br />
(Green rug unfurled to greet the world)<br />
Has turned to tawny brown and bare<br />
Except where crabgrass clings, like tufts of hair.
</p>
<p>
Though droopy plants are nodding off<br />
And parched earth cries for dew and rain,<br />
The oaks stand strong (their roots run deep)<br />
And life is merely lying low, asleep.
</p>

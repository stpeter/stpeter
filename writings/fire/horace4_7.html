<h2>"The Snows Have Fled"</h2>
<h3>(Horace, Odes IV.7)</h3>
<h4>translated by Peter Saint-Andre</h4>
<p>
The snows have fled, already<br />
The grass returns to the fields<br />
And leaves return to the trees.<br />
Earth is turning her changes,<br />
The rivers flow less strongly.
</p>
<p>
Grace along with her Nymphs and<br />
Twin sisters ventures naked<br />
To lead her bands of dancers.<br />
"Hope for immortality<br />
Not", warn the year and the hour<br />
That steal the nourishing day.
</p>
<p>
The Zephyr lessens the cold,<br />
The Summer tramples the Spring<br />
Only to be overturned<br />
As soon as fruit-bearing Fall<br />
Has poured forth its crops, and soon<br />
Dead winter returns again.
</p>
<p>
Swift moons heal the heavenly<br />
Damage &mdash; but we, when we have<br />
Gone down where good Aeneas,<br />
Where rich Tullus and Arcus<br />
Have gone &mdash; we are dust and shade.
</p>
<p>
Who knows if the gods will add<br />
Tomorrow's time to our sum?<br />
The only thing that escapes<br />
Your heir's grasping hands will be<br />
What you've added to your soul.
</p>
<p>
When once you've died and Minos<br />
Has given his distinguished<br />
Judgment, nothing, Torquatus &mdash;<br />
Not birth nor eloquence nor<br />
Goodness &mdash; will restore your life.
</p>
<p>
For Diana can't release<br />
Good Hippolytus from the<br />
Darkness, nor has Theseus<br />
The power to burst the chains<br />
Of his dear Peritho&#246;s.
</p>

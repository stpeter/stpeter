<h2>"The Snows Have Fled"</h2>
<h3>(Horace, Odes IV.7)</h3>
<h4>translated by Peter Saint-Andre</h4>
<p>
The snows have fled, already grass returns<br/>
To the fields and leaves return to the trees.<br />
Earth turns her changes; rivers are slowing.<br/>
Grace with her Nymphs and twin sisters ventures<br />
Forth naked to lead her bands of dancers.<br />
The year and the hour that steal away<br/>
The nourishing day give us their warning:<br/>
"Don't hold out hope for immortality."<br />
The Zephyr lessens the cold, the Summer<br/>
Tramples the Spring but then is overturned<br />
When fruit-bearing Fall has poured forth its crops;<Br/>
Soon enough dead winter returns again.<br/>
Swift moons will heal the heavenly damage&nbsp;&mdash;<br />
But when finally we have gone down where<br />
Good Aeneas, rich Tullus, and Arcus<br/>
Have gone &mdash; we will become mere dust and shade.<br/>
Who knows if the gods will add to our sum<br />
Tomorrow? The only thing that escapes<br />
Your heir is what you've added to your soul.<br/>
When you have died and Minos has given<br />
His judgment, nothing, Torquatus &mdash; not birth<br/>
Nor eloquence nor worth &mdash; restores your life.<br/>
Diana can't release Hippolytus<br />
From darkness; Theseus lacks the power<br />
To burst the chains of dear Peritho√∂s.

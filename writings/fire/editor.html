<h1>Editor</h1>
<h2>by Peter Saint-Andre</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
There's nothing that's quite as horrific<br />
as an editor's pen prolific<br />
marking off which word, which phrase, which page<br />
survives unscathed the editor's rage.<br />
['Rampage', perhaps, is more specific.&nbsp;&#151; Ed.]
</p>
<p>
You'll start to feel the imposition<br />
of add and cut and transposition,<br />
you'll start to fight for your wordy dream<br />
against those changes that make you scream<nobr>....<nobr><br />
Confronted with his erudition<br />
your protest ends up in contrition.
</p>
<p>
Eventually you'll drop resistance,<br />
you'll change it all at his insistence,<br />
in this and each and every instance.<br />
And all of this madness for a fee&nbsp;&#151; <br />
you'll dearly wish that he just could be<br />
edited right out of existence!

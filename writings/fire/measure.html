<h2>The Measure</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p><em>Encampment River Trail, October 7th, 2000</em></p>
<p>
A million grains lie in the glass:<br />
the hours that fate may let me pass,<br />
the hours of striving or of rest<br />
(what at that moment I deem best).
</p>
<p>
Half of the grains wait in the top,<br />
half of the grains lie where they've dropped,<br />
one grain alone moves as I live:<br />
the hour that's full of what I give.
</p>
<p>
This hour can seem to last a day<br />
if I but let my powers play<br />
and give what's of my deepest core:<br />
thought, choice, and action -- nothing more.
</p>
<p>
Yet what for me is nothing less<br />
are powers mixed with interest<br />
that long and deep in me abides<br />
where life and nature coincide.
</p>
<p>
It's here that, when attention's strong,<br />
each moment seems an hour long,<br />
the flow of time is one with pleasure,<br />
and life achieves its natural measure.
</p>

<h2>Reflections on My Father's Life</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
As the generations of leaves,<br />
So the generations of men.<br />
Down to earth the wind shoots the leaves,<br />
But forest trees burst forth again<br />
In the hour when spring is born:<br />
So one generation of men<br /> 
Dies off while another grows strong.<br />
<cite>The Iliad, VI.146-149</cite>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As the generations of leaves,<br />
So the generations of men.<br />
Yet what's the value of one leaf?<br />
Can it be just to grow the stem?<br />
I think not, but I'm not sure why:<br />
For if I say, as I am wont,<br />
That meaning's made whenever I<br />
Create some value in the world,<br />
Then it would seem the worth of one<br />
Is only in his strength to serve,<br />
To build the beam and build the bough<br />
So others yet may bud and grow<br />
And, having built, may fall to earth<br />
When winter of their time has come.<br />
</p>
<p>
But so to speak ignores the joy<br />
And pride that comes from bringing new<br />
And unique value to the world<br />
Or keeping whole what's come before,<br />
For sake of others and oneself.<br />
For there's no conflict here: we each<br />
Pursue an interest in the good<br />
Through single acts that are yet whole<br />
And so create without intent<br />
A world that's better for us all.<br />
</p>
<p>
Thus my father lived: he healed men<br />
Who fought in war then fought again<br />
To gain their health; he sought to save<br />
The land he loved and to preserve<br />
A life long lost through buildings that<br />
The farmers made before our time<br />
(He tried to keep their virtues, too:<br />
Straight honesty with all he knew);<br />
He kept his wife till death did part<br />
And raised four children, all with love<br />
And joy in that most awesome task.<br />
</p>
<p>
A leaf has fallen from the tree:<br/>
And all I ask is that he gain<br/>
A due amount of honor from<br/>
The ones he touched and left behind.<br/>
A leaf has fallen from the tree:</br>
He lived with pride, he lived with joy,<br/>
And we who gather here today<br/>
Are better for his having lived.

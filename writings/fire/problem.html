<h1>The Problem of the One and the Many</h1>
<h2>by Peter Saint-Andre</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
We are all familiar, I should say, with the way geese gaggle,<br />
bees swarm, and oxen yoke -- the way that sheep and seagulls straggle<br />
when they unwisely stray from their appointed flock.
</p>
<p>
But do you have an inkling of the strange and wondrous habits<br />
of creatures as divergent as rhinoceri and rabbits?<br />
Animals guard secrets their fancy names unlock . . . . 
</p>
<p>
To begin, we know that a group is made of ones who muster,<br />
and our animal friends gain fantastic names when they cluster --<br />
like the nightingales, who en masse become a watch.
</p>
<p>
Watches of birds, though, I dare say, are nothing nearly so strange<br />
as troops of kangaroos (in formation) hopping on the range,<br />
or holy exaltations of ecstatic larks!
</p>
<p>
But turn from sacred to profane: consider the lowly crow,<br />
whose group is called a murder!  And the elks, who in numbers show<br />
themselves to be a gang -- yet still they roam our parks!
</p>
<p>
A litter of piglets, a pod of seals, turtles in a bale:<br />
shall we tie them with a string of ponies, set them out for sale --<br />
on a bed of oysters, for optimum display?
</p>
<p>
. . . . The words are stuck like a knot of toads, to tell me who I am,<br />
how I should live and travel: whether grouped like whales in a gam<br />
or alone, like a needle in a stack of hay . . . .
</p>
<p>
A company of parrots may be founded by one who dares,<br />
a school of fish or a band of monkeys formed by one who cares;<br />
the peace of nations dreamt by doves who league in dules.
</p>
<p>
Hens and chicks, or so I've heard, have tendencies to brood and clutch;<br />
the hogs just drift, the hares are down, and the foxes skulk so much<br />
they've lost their craft at leaping over spans of mules.
</p>
<p>
See the mustering of the storks, and the vicious hordes of gnats!<br />
Hounds are mute and the woodcocks fall 'midst the clutter of the cats<br />
while the herons' siege runs strong, sounder than the swine.
</p>
<p>
But hark, glad tidings of magpies!  For the finches love to charm:<br />
bouquets of pheasants (they are aware) can surely do no harm;<br />
sparrows play gracious host, and cast their hawks like wine.
</p>
<p>
Pride, all but the lions know, is commonly counted a sin --<br />
a plague of locusts on your house if you let such vices in<br />
as peacock ostentation, and the sloth of bears.
</p>
<p>
What can one build?  Perhaps a nest, of rabbits or of vipers!<br />
Or a route of wolves for trips of goats, safe from tribes of snipers,<br />
where cattle drove in fear of dragons in their lairs!
</p>
<p>
Build and build again: rafters of turkeys, colonies of ants:<br />
seek the aid of an elephant herd to help you make your chance,<br />
ignore the starlings' murmurations while you're young . . . .
</p>
<p>
What can we learn from animal terms against which you may rail,<br />
from teams of horses and ducks, from coveys of partridge and quail?<br />
The question, I'm sure, is on the tip of your tongue:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Am I just part of a swarm or clan,<br />
mere member of some coterie?<br />
Or perhaps, perhaps, am I a man --<br />
alone, myself, uniquely me?
</p>
</blockquote>

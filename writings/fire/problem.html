<h1>The Problem of the One and the Many</h1>
<h2>by Peter Saint-Andre</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
We are all familiar, I should say, with the way geese gaggle,<br />
Bees swarm, and oxen yoke &mdash; the way that sheep and seagulls straggle<br />
When they unwisely stray from their appointed flock.
</p>
<p>
But do you have an inkling of the strange and wondrous habits<br />
Of creatures as divergent as rhinoceri and rabbits?<br />
Animals guard secrets their fancy names unlock.... 
</p>
<p>
To begin, we know that a group is made of ones who muster,<br />
And animals acquire curious names when they cluster&nbsp;&mdash;<br />
Like the nightingales, who en masse become a watch.
</p>
<p>
Watches of birds, though, I dare say, aren't nearly so strange<br />
As troops of hopping kangaroos that turn out on the range,<br />
Or holy exaltations of ecstatic larks!
</p>
<p>
But turn from sacred to profane: think of the lowly crow,<br />
Whose group is called a murder!  And the elks, who numbered show<br />
Themselves to be a gang &mdash; yet still they roam our parks!
</p>
<p>
Litters of piglets, pods of seals, or turtles in a bale:<br />
Shall we tie them with strings of ponies, set them out for sale&nbsp;&mdash;<br />
On a bed of oysters, for optimum display?
</p>
<p>
The words are stuck like knots of toads, to tell me who I am,<br />
How I should live and travel: if grouped like whales in a gam<br />
Or alone, like a needle in a stack of hay....
</p>
<p>
Companies of parrots may be founded by one who dares,<br />
Schools of fish or bands of monkeys started by one who cares;<br />
The peace of nations dreamt by doves who league in dules.
</p>
<p>
Hens and chicks, so I've heard, have tendencies to brood and clutch;<br />
The hogs just drift, the hares are down, and foxes skulk so much<br />
They've lost their craft at leaping over spans of mules.
</p>
<p>
See the mustering of the storks, and vicious hordes of gnats!<br />
Hounds are mute and woodcocks fall 'midst the clutter of the cats<br />
While the herons' siege runs strong, sounder than the swine.
</p>
<p>
But hark, glad tidings of magpies! For finches love to charm:<br />
Bouquets of pheasants (they're aware) can surely do no harm;<br />
Sparrows play gracious host, and cast their hawks like wine.
</p>
<p>
Pride, as all but lions know, is widely counted a sin&nbsp;&mdash;<br />
Plagues of locusts on your house if you let such vices in<br />
As peacock ostentation, and the sloth of bears.
</p>
<p>
What can one build?  Perhaps a nest, of rabbits or of vipers!<br />
Or routes of wolves for trips of goats, safe from the tribes of snipers,<br />
Where cattle drove in fear of dragons in their lairs!
</p>
<p>
Build and build again: rafters of turkeys, colonies of ants:<br />
Seek the aid of an elephant herd to help you make your chance,<br />
Ignore the starlings' murmurations while you're young....
</p>
<p>
What can we learn from these odd terms against which you may rail,<br />
From teams of horses and ducks, coveys of partridge and quail?<br />
The question, I'm sure, is on the tip of your tongue:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Am I part of a swarm or clan,<br />
Mere member of some coterie?<br />
Perhaps, perhaps, am I a man&nbsp;&mdash;<br />
Alone, myself, uniquely me?
</p>
</blockquote>

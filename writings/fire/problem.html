<h1>The Problem of the One and the Many</h1>
<h2>by Peter Saint-Andre</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
We are all familiar, I should say, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the way geese gaggle,<br />
Bees swarm, and oxen yoke -- the way that <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheep and seagulls straggle<br />
When they unwisely stray from their appointed flock.
</p>
<p>
But do you have an inkling of the <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strange and wondrous habits<br />
Of creatures as divergent as <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rhinoceri and rabbits?<br />
Animals guard secrets their fancy names unlock . . . . 
</p>
<p>
To begin, we know that a group <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is made of ones who muster,<br />
And our animal friends acquire <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;curious names when they cluster --<br />
Like the nightingales, who en masse become a watch.
</p>
<p>
Watches of birds, though, I dare say, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are nothing nearly so strange<br />
As troops of kangaroos hopping <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in formation on the range,<br />
Or holy exaltations of ecstatic larks!
</p>
<p>
But turn from sacred to profane: <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider the lowly crow,<br />
Whose group is called a murder!  And the <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elks, who in numbers show<br />
Themselves to be a gang -- yet still they roam our parks!
</p>
<p>
A litter of piglets, a pod of <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seals, turtles in a bale:<br />
Shall we tie them with a string of <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ponies, set them out for sale --<br />
On a bed of oysters, for optimum display?
</p>
<p>
The words are stuck like a knot of <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;toads, to tell me who I am,<br />
How I should live and travel: if <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grouped like whales in a gam<br />
Or alone, like a needle in a stack of hay . . . .
</p>
<p>
A company of parrots may be <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;founded by one who dares,<br />
A school of fish or a band of monkeys <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;started by one who cares;<br />
The peace of nations dreamt by doves who league in dules.
</p>
<p>
Hens and chicks, or so I've heard, have <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tendencies to brood and clutch;<br />
The hogs just drift, the hares are down, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the foxes skulk so much<br />
They've lost their craft at leaping over spans of mules.
</p>
<p>
See the mustering of the storks, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the vicious hordes of gnats!<br />
Hounds are mute and the woodcocks fall <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'midst the clutter of the cats<br />
While the herons' siege runs strong, sounder than the swine.
</p>
<p>
But hark, glad tidings of magpies!  <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the finches love to charm:<br />
Bouquets of pheasants (they are aware) <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can surely do no harm;<br />
Sparrows play gracious host, and cast their hawks like wine.
</p>
<p>
Pride, all but the lions know, is <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commonly counted a sin --<br />
A plague of locusts on your house <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you let such vices in<br />
As peacock ostentation, and the sloth of bears.
</p>
<p>
What can one build?  Perhaps a nest, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of rabbits or of vipers!<br />
Or a route of wolves for trips of goats, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;safe from tribes of snipers,<br />
Where cattle drove in fear of dragons in their lairs!
</p>
<p>
Build and build again: rafters of <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turkeys, colonies of ants:<br />
Seek the aid of an elephant herd <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to help you make your chance,<br />
Ignore the starlings' murmurations while you're young . . . .
</p>
<p>
What can we learn from animal terms <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against which you may rail,<br />
From teams of horses and ducks, from <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coveys of partridge and quail?<br />
The question, I'm sure, is on the tip of your tongue:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Am I just part of a swarm or clan,<br />
Mere member of some coterie?<br />
Or perhaps, perhaps, am I a man --<br />
Alone, myself, uniquely me?
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>"I Have Completed a Monument"</h2>
<h3>(Horace, Odes III.30)</h3>
<h4>translated by Peter Saint-Andre</h4>
<p>
I have completed a monument<br />
more lasting than bronze and far higher<br />
than that royal pile of Pyramids,<br />
which the gnawing rain and furious<br />
north wind cannot destroy, nor the chain<br />
of countless years and the flight of time.<br />
My end won't be complete, and a great<br />
part of me will evade the death-god:<br />
I'll prosper on, fresh with future praise.<br />
As long as the priest with the silent<br />
virgin climbs the Capitoline hill,<br />
high and low -- where raging Aufidus<br />
thunders, where Daunus rules over a<br />
farming people poor of water -- I<br />
will be proclaimed to have been the first<br />
to adapt Aeolic songs into<br />
Italian measures. Melpomene,<br />
accept the proud honor you have earned<br />
and crown my head with Delphic laurel.

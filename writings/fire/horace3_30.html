<h2>"I Have Completed a Monument"</h2>
<h3>(Horace, Odes III.30)</h3>
<h4>translated by Peter Saint-Andre</h4>
<p>
I have completed a monument<br />
More lasting than bronze and far higher<br />
Than that royal pile of Pyramids,<br />
Which the gnawing rain and furious<br />
North wind cannot destroy, nor the chain<br />
Of countless years and the flight of time.<br />
My end won't be complete, and a great<br />
Part of me will evade the death god:<br />
I'll prosper on, fresh with future praise.<br />
As long as the priest with the silent<br />
Virgin climbs the Capitoline hill,<br />
High and low &mdash; where raging Aufidus<br />
Thunders, where Daunus rules over a<br />
Farming people poor of water &mdash; I<br />
Will be proclaimed to have been the first<br />
To adapt Aeolic songs into<br />
Italian measures. Melpomene,<br />
Accept the proud honor you have earned<br />
And crown my head with Delphic laurel.

<h2>"Keep a Tranquil Mind"</h2>
<h3>(Horace Odes II.3)</h3>
<h4>translated by Peter Saint-Andre</h4>
<p>
Remember in difficult times to<br />
keep a tranquil mind, and in good times<br />
to keep from becoming overjoyed,<br />
my Dellius who is yet to die,
</p>
<p>
whether you live always in sadness<br />
or on festal days in far-off field<br />
reclining you take delight in a<br />
famed vintage of Falernian wine.
</p>
<p>
Why do the tall pine and white poplar<br />
love to unite their foliage in<br />
inviting shade? Why does the rushing<br />
water press on through its winding banks?
</p>
<p>
Bring wines and perfumes and the too-brief<br />
flower that blooms on the lovely rose<br />
while good fortune and our youth allow,<br />
and the dark threads of the three Sisters.
</p>
<p>
You'll leave your boughten lands and your house<br />
in the country, washed by the Tiber --<br />
you'll leave them, and some heir will acquire<br />
the wealth you piled high. And whether
</p>
<p>
you're rich and of ancient lineage<br />
or you're poor and sleep beneath the stars,<br />
in the end it makes no difference: for<br />
pitiless Orcus will have your soul.
</p>
<p>
We are all gathered to the same place:<br />
the lot of all is turned in the urn<br />
of Fate, who will come forth and place us<br />
in the skiff, for eternal exile.
</p>

<h2>Ancient Fire</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>
Sing me, Muse, of your bright sister &mdash; small and dark,<br />
They say she was, though I shall never know her.<br />
Her song is lost, yet even her merest shards<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are a vibrant spark.
</p>
<p>
She is like a god to me, who sang that song<br />
Of love for what one loves. A pagan was she,<br />
Whose Christian fate it was to burn, her art cut<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short when night grew long.
</p>
<p>
Misguided faith I can forgive, but to lose<br />
The greatest of the poets, whose song should live,<br />
I cannot bear. I can but pay her homage:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sappho, be my muse.
</p>

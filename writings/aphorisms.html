<h1>Peter Saint-Andre: Aphorisms</h1>
<p>Don't puzzle endlessly over the meaning of life, but work actively to create a life of meaning.</p>
<p>I strive to shed my illusions as easily as the snake sheds its skin; yet the fact that I must strive shows have hard it really is.</p>
<p>Spend time with your friends; they can't be replaced.</p>
<p>It's always better to walk the path than to run the path.</p>
<p>Just because one has good and beautiful things of great worth, does not mean one is living a good and beautiful and worthy life.</p>
<p>No ideology has a monopoloy on hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Questions are quick; answers are slow.</p>
<p>If someone tells you that your window of opportunity is closing, remember: a beautiful house has many windows.</p>
<p>Everyone is strange, it's just a question of in what ways.</p>
<p>Democracy is what happens when people hold power, not their so-called representatives.</p>
<p>Any government that makes war on its own people has lost the consent of the governed and all moral legitimacy.</p>
<p>Excellence is a worthy goal, but perfection is unattainable.</p>
<p>Utopia is not an option.</p>
<p>Someone who tells you how ethical they are, probably isn't.</p>
<p>The unexamined organization is not worth building.</p>
<p>Sometimes the best thing to do is not the fastest or most efficient thing to do. This is called learning.</p>
<p>Ethics is what you do, not what you believe.</p>
<p>You don't need to achieve an ideal to experience the benefits of idealism.</p>
<p>A good life is embodied wisdom.</p>
<p>Having an open mind doesn't mean you need to close your eyes.</p>
<p>The health of an organization's culture is inversely proportional to the amount of time they spend talking about it.</p>

<h1>Peter Saint-Andre: Aphorisms</h1>
<p>Last Updated: 2019-09-15</p>
<p>Distrust all gurus; instead, be your own guru; even then, distrust yourself.</p>
<p>The easiest thing in the world is self-deception.</p>
<p>Perfection is not an option.</p>
<p>Happiness is the best revenge.</p>
<p>There's no monopoly on hypocrisy.</p>
<p>You don't have to achieve an ideal to benefit from idealism.</p>
<p>Philosophy is a verb, not a noun.</p>
<p>Ethics is what you do, not what you profess.</p>
<p>Someone who tells you how ethical they are, probably isn't.</p>
<p>Everyone is weird, it's a question of specifically how.</p>
<p>Having an open mind doesn't mean you need to close your eyes.</p>
<p>To avoid groupthink, avoid groups.</p>
<p>Demonization and deification are two sides of the same false coin.</p>
<p>Morality is telling people how to be; metaphysics is telling reality how to be.</p>
<p>Spend time with your friends; they can't be replaced.</p>
<p>Questions are quick; answers are slow.</p>
<p>It's always better to walk the path than to run the path.</p>
<p>A good life is embodied wisdom.</p>
<p>Don't puzzle over the meaning of life, but work to create a life of meaning.</p>
<p>Just because you have good and beautiful things of great worth, does not mean you are living a good and beautiful and worthy life.</p>
<p>Don't envy those who envy others.</p>
<p>The unexamined organization is not worth building.</p>
<p>The health of a team's culture is inversely proportional to the amount of time they spend saying how great it is.</p>
<p>Sometimes the best thing to do is not the fastest or most efficient thing to do. This is called learning.</p>
<p>I strive to shed my illusions as easily as the snake sheds its skin; yet the fact that I must strive shows how hard it truly is.</p>
<p>If someone tells you that your window of opportunity is closing, remember: a beautiful house has many windows.</p>
<li>Creation is a singularly rare event; most of life - even of art, religion, and philosophy - is a matter of maintenance.</li>
<p>A book of poems is like a box of chocolates &mdash; best not consumed in one sitting.</p>
<p>If you can conceive of morality without god, why can you not conceive of society without government?</p>
<p>If you can conceive of spirituality without faith, why can you not conceive of government without coercion?</p>
<p>Democracy is what happens when people hold power &mdash; not their so-called representatives.</p>
<p>Any government that makes war on its own people has lost the consent of the governed and all moral legitimacy.</p>
<p>The problem with elections is that those who are elected think they are the elect.</p>
<p>Every specialist overestimates the importance of their own specialty.</p>
<p>Utopia is not an option.</p>
<p>Systemic problems require systemic solutions, and our problems are deeply systemic.</p>
<p>One wonders how many characteristics of modern music - its agitation, its emotionalism, its seductiveness, its lack of inhibitions - are caused by the fact that it is performed after dark by night people.</p>
<p>We moderns, especially we Americans, are perpetual children, preferring entertainment to wisdom and momentary pleasures to a good life.</p>
<p>Everything is great, but no one strives for greatness.</p>
<p>Although we like to believe that our technologies are tools, in fact we are tools of our technologies.</p>
<p>We can learn much about modern society from adjectives that have passed out of use; consider ‘villainous’, ‘base’, and ‘unseemly’.</p>
<p>The clothing that people wear today reveals much about their bodies, but it reveals even more about their souls.</p>
<p>Never underestimate the power of a false alternative.</p>

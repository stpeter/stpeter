<h1>Peter Saint-Andre: Aphorisms</h1>
<p>Distrust all gurus. Instead, be your own guru. Even then, distrust yourself.</p>
<p>The easiest thing in the world is self-deception.</p>
<p>Perfection is not an option.</p>
<p>Happiness is the best revenge.</p>
<p>There's no monopoly on hypocrisy.</p>
<p>You don't have to achieve an ideal to benefit from idealism.</p>
<p>Ethics is what you do, not what you profess.</p>
<p>Someone who tells you how ethical they are, probably isn't.</p>
<p>Everyone is weird, it's a question of specifically how.</p>
<p>Having an open mind doesn't mean you need to close your eyes.</p>
<p>Demonization and deification are two sides of the same false coin.</p>
<p>Morality is telling people how to be; metaphysics is telling reality how to be.</p>
<p>Spend time with your friends; they can't be replaced.</p>
<p>Questions are quick; answers are slow.</p>
<p>It's always better to walk the path than to run the path.</p>
<p>A good life is embodied wisdom.</p>
<p>Don't puzzle over the meaning of life, but work to create a life of meaning.</p>
<p>Just because one has good and beautiful things of great worth, does not mean one is living a good and beautiful and worthy life.</p>
<p>Don't envy those who envy others.</p>
<p>The unexamined organization is not worth building.</p>
<p>The health of a team's culture is inversely proportional to the amount of time they spend talking about it.</p>
<p>Sometimes the best thing to do is not the fastest or most efficient thing to do. This is called learning.</p>
<p>Strive to shed your illusions as easily as the snake sheds its skin; yet the fact that you must strive shows how hard it really is.</p>
<p>If someone tells you that your window of opportunity is closing, remember: a beautiful house has many windows.</p>
<p>If you can conceive of morality without god, why can you not conceive of society without government?</p>
<p>If you can conceive of religion without faith, why can you not conceive of government without coercion?</p>
<p>Democracy is what happens when people hold power, not their so-called representatives.</p>
<p>Any government that makes war on its own people has lost the consent of the governed and all moral legitimacy.</p>
<p>The problem with elections is that those who are elected think they are the elect.</p>
<p>A book of poems is like a box of chocolates: best not consumed in one sitting.</p>

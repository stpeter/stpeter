<h1>Boulder Commencement Address</h1>
<h2>by Peter Saint-Andre</h2>
<p><em>To be delivered at the commencement ceremony of the Department of Philosophy, University of Colorado Boulder, May 10, 2019.</em></p>
<p>It is an honor to be here with you today. I would like to begin with the final syllogism of your college philosophy experience:</p>
<blockquote>
Commencement addresses are full of unsolicited advice.<br/>
Unsolicited advice is useless.<br/>
Therefore commencement addresses are useless.
</blockquote>
<p>I hope to avoid the inexorable consequences of this Aristotelian logic and say something of value to you.</p>
<p>But first, thanks to Professor Steup, chair of this flourishing department, for inviting me, and to Professor Lee, with whom I graduated from Columbia University in ancient philosophy thirty years ago.</p>
<p>Second, I would like to praise the parents. In my experience, the usual reaction upon learning that your child has chosen philosophy is: "You're majoring in what?!" You are to be commended for staying the course.</p>
<p>Third, my congratulations to the graduates. Although our beloved discipline is sometimes the butt of jokes, we know that philosophy is a tough major. Unfortunately it doesn't get any easier, because you're about to enter the real world, where the path to success is far from assured, especially for philosophy majors.</p>
<p>Yet I'm here to show you it's possible. In fact, I'll try to prove that you have some philosophical super powers on your side!</p>
<p>Who am I to tell you? Thirty years ago I graduated with a degree in Philosophy and Classics, and no job prospects. I bounced around for years before I got in on ground floor of the Internet boom. Nowadays I'm a Principal Engineer on the Mozilla Firefox web browser, where I manage our technical relationships with strategic partners like Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. In my spare time I also write philosophy books on the side.</p>
<p>But don't take my word for it. We've all heard about famous philosophy majors such as Supreme Court justices Souter and Breyer, billionaire investors like George Soros and LinkedIn founder Reed Hoffman, even movie stars like Harrison Ford.</p>
<p>For our purposes, perhaps the most challenging student of philosophy is comedian Steve Martin. He once joked that a major like geology wasn't a problem because it just presented a bunch of facts that you'd forget immediately, whereas with philosophy enough stayed with you to <em>mess you up forever</em>.</p>
<p>Steve is funny, but I think he's wrong. In good Hegelian fashion, I'll offer a thesis, challenge it with an antithesis, and provide a synthesis that turns his joke upside down.</p>
<p>My thesis is that philosophy is a great foundation for success.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>First, philosophy majors are smart, and intelligence is highly correlated with career success.</p>
<p>Second, philosophy majors learn some key skills: thinking critically, logically, creatively, and systematically; analyzing hard problems and finding solutions; writing clearly and communicating persuasively; understanding different viewpoints; handling ambiguous situations and dealing with paradox; and many more.</p>
<p>These higher-order skills are extremely valuable in the workplace because few people can do them well. They are becoming more important as routine tasks are automated, and they help you stand out as you advance in your career. This is why philosophy majors can become higher earners. Indeed, by mid-career, the 90 percentile of philosophy majors get paid more than the 90th percentile of, say, electrical engineers.</p>
<p>So that's my thesis. The antithesis is that philosophy provides no guarantee of success. In fact, it can actively hamper you in several ways.</p>
<p>First, you might need to adjust your attitude. It's not good to be just a "big idea" person. In my industry we talk about starters, who dream up things to do, and finishers, who get things done. People who get things done are recognized, respected, and rewarded. People who dream up things to do eventually get assigned to special projects or shunted aside entirely.</p>
<p>You want to be a finisher. However, if you like big ideas, this might require significant self-discipline. You'll need to learn career-relevant skills that might seem boring, unpleasant, hopelessly bourgeois, vaguely unethical, or downright frightening. Examples include time management, customer service, negotiation, navigating office politics, and public speaking. Motivating yourself to learn these skills can be a challenge, but it's aboslutely necessary.</p>
<p>Second, philosophy doesn't give you practical knowledge and skills. In the real world, no one is going to pay you for your knowledge of the categorical imperative or your mastery of symbolic logic. To climb the career ladder, you first need to get on the bottom rung, and that means learning practical skills that employers will pay for, in a field like computer programming, statistics, business, even accounting. It's never too late to begin learning such skills, and in any case you'll need to keep doing that for as long as you're in the workforce, so you might as well get started.</p>
<p>In fact, because the career landscape is changing faster and faster, ten or twenty years from you might be doing a job that doesn't even exist right now. Philosophy gives you the mental flexibility to handle that kind of change, if you can combine your higher-order knowledge and skills with practical learning and experience. A colleague of mine at Mozilla calls this a super power, because she notes that very few people can both visualize a big-picture solution and also make it happen in practice. Thus my synthesis: philosophy plus practicality is a recipe for success.</p>
<p>But now we come to the philosophical part of my talk, because I'd like to challenge you by asking a Socratic question: what is success?</p>
<p>So far we've talked about career success, but there are much more important reasons to make philosophy a lifelong pursuit.</p>
<p>First, itâ€™s a fascinating, challenging, and beautiful realm of human inquiry. The love of wisdom is intrinsically rewarding. By living an examined life, you make your life worth living.</p>
<p>Second, great thinkers teach us great values like self-knowledge, mindfulness, moderation, patience, courage, justice, fairness, truthfulness, and mutual respect. These qualities are consistent throughout every philosophical tradition. Yes, they're valuable at work, but they're even more valuable in your personal relationships.</p>
<p>Third, cultivating what Pierre Hadot called philosophy as a way of life can help you become not just highly accomplished in your career, but highly accomplished as a human being. Spinoza ended his <cite>Ethics</cite> by saying that all things excellent as as difficult as they are rare. Your grounding in philosophy gives you the best of foundations, and now it's up to each one of you to become an accomplished, excellent, exceptional <em>person</em>. In that highest of pursuits I wish you the best of success.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>Mount Monadnock: American Olympus</h2>

<p>The Westeran Abenaki called it <em>menonadenak</em> ("smooth mountain") or <em>menadena</em> ("isolated mountain"). The geologists use its name as a generic term for "a single remnant of a former highland, which rises as an isolated rock mass above a plain". Nathaniel Hawthorne likened it to "a sapphire cloud against the sky". Ralph Waldo Emerson called it "the new Olympus".</p>
<p>It is Mount Monadnock, a 3,165-foot mountain in Cheshire County, New Hampshire. A paltry hill compared to Denali, Mount Whitney, Pikes Peak, even Mount Washington 100 miles to the north. Yet it loomed large in the consciousness of the American Renaissance. Thoreau climbed it in 1844, 1852, 1858, and 1860, Emerson in 1845 and ????. The mountain inspired Hawthorne, Thoreau, Emerson, Rudyard Kipling, Mark Twain, Willa Cather, Edwin Arlington Robinson, possibly Emily Dickinson, the painter Abbott Thayer, and the architect John Root.</p>

<h3>Thoreau</h3>

<p>Henry David Thoreau loved mountains. In the first version of <em>Walden</em> he wrote: "on the tops of mountains, as everywhere to hopeful souls, it is always morning". He thought that climbing mountains was a way of experiencing "your own higher latitudes", which "elevated and etherialized" the climber. The reason is that in the solitude of mountain vastness one can "find God in nature" and perceive the world as "living and divine"; for "mountains thus seen are worthy of worship".</p>
<p>The mountain Thoreau loved most was Monadnock (in this choice he perhaps influenced, or was influenced by, <a href="/whatis/emerson.html">Emerson</a>). While it was not the highest mountain he climbed, it impressed him above all others: "that New Hampshire bluff, that promontory of a state &hellip; will longest haunt our dreams". Thoreau climbed Monadnock in 1844, 1852, 1858, and 1860 and recorded extensive botanical and geological observations in his journal (indeed, a bog that he studied on the mountain is named after him). However, his journal entries also hint at the spiritual meaning that the mountain held for him; here are some excerpts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Almost without interruption we had the mountain in sight before us,&#151;its sublime gray mass&#151;that antique, brownish-gray, Ararat color. Probably these crests of the earth are for the most part of one color in all lands, that gray color of antiquity, which nature loves."</p>
<p>Thoreau observed nighthawks on the mountain: "their dry and unmusical, yet supramundane and spirit-like, voices and sounds gave fit expression to this rocky mountain solitude. It struck the very key-note of the stern, gray, solitude. It was a thrumming of the mountain's rocky chords."</p>
<p>Monadnock "often reminded me of my walks on the beach, and suggested how much both depend for their sublimity on solitude and dreariness. In both cases we feel the presence of some vast, titanic power."</p>
<p>"Those who climb to the peak of Monadnock have seen but little of the mountain. I came not to look <em>off from</em> it, but to look <em>at</em> it. The view of the pinnacle itself from the plateau below surpasses any view which you get from the summit. It is indispensible to see the top itself and the sierra of its outline from one side.... It is remarkable what haste the visitors make to get to the top of the mountain and then look away from it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The opening section of Thoreau's poem "With Frontier Strength Ye Stand Your Guard" also contains praise for Monadnock:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With frontier strength ye stand your guard,<br />
With grand content ye circle round,<br />
Tumultuous silence for all sound,<br />
Ye distant nursery of rills,<br />
Monadnock and the Peterborough Hills;&#151;<br />
Firm argument that never stirs,<br />
Outcircling the philosophers,&#151;<br />
Like some vast fleet,<br />
Sailing through rain and sleet,<br />
Through winter's cold and summer's heat;<br />
Still holding on upon your high emprise,<br />
Until ye find a shore amid the skies;<br />
Not skulking close to land,<br />
With cargo contraband,<br />
For they who sent a venture out by ye<br />
Have set the Sun to see<br />
Their honesty.<br />
Ships of the line, each one,<br />
Ye westward run,<br />
Convoying clouds,<br />
Which cluster in your shrouds,<br />
Always before the gale,<br />
Under a press of sail,<br />
With weight of metal all untold,&#151;<br />
I seem to feel ye in my firm seat here,<br />
Immeasurable depth of hold,<br />
And breadth of beam, and length of running gear.<br />
Methinks ye take luxurious pleasure<br />
In your novel western leisure;<br />
So cool your brows and freshly blue,<br />
As Time had naught for ye to do;<br />
For ye lie at your length,<br />
An unappropriated strength,<br />
Unhewn primeval timber,<br />
For knees so stiff, for masts so limber;<br />
The stock of which new earths are made,<br />
One day to be our western trade,<br />
Fit for the stanchions of a world<br />
Which through the seas of space is hurled....
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, Thoreau was not just a naturalist but also a consummate individualist; here are some thoughts of his which seem most in alignment with our aims here at the <a href="/" target="_top">Monadnock Review</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are nowadays professors of philosophy, but not philosophers.  Yet it is admirable to profess because it was once admirable to live. To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not just theoretically, but practically.</p>
<p>Let us settle ourselves, and work and wedge our feet downward through the mud and slush of opinion, and prejudice and tradition, and delusion, and appearance, that alluvion which covers the globe&hellip;till we come to the hard bottom of rocks in place, which we can call reality.</p>

<h3>Emerson</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
Dark Flower of Cheshire garden<br />
Red Evening duly dyes<br />
Thy sombre head with rosy hues<br />
To fix fargazing eyes.<br />
Well the planter knew how strongly<br />
Works thy form on human thought:<br />
I muse what secret purpose had he<br />
To draw all fancies to this spot.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What follows is Emerson's long poem <em>Monadnoc</em>, which he began writing at the top of the mountain on the morning of 3 May 1845. While it took me several readings of this poem to absorb his meanings, and not all of his thoughts (or their sometimes archaic and rambling expression) are congenial to me, I think Emerson's Monadnock can still inspire today. It's interesting to note that the central section, in which Emerson extols the natural speech and industrious ingenuity of common people, strongly influenced the poetic practice of Robert Frost. One can also detect some of the heroic humanism that Nietzsche so admired about Emerson (and Nietzsche, in turn, strongly influenced the young <a href="/whatis/rand.html">Ayn Rand</a>; do I sense a pattern here?).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Thousand minstrels woke within me,<br />
"Our music's in the hills;"&#151;<br />
Gayest pictures rose to win me,<br />
Leopard-colored rills.<br />
Up!&#151;If thou knew'st who calls<br />
To twilight parks of beech and pine,<br />
High over the river intervals,<br />
Above the ploughman's highest line,<br />
Over the owner's farthest walls!<br />
Up! where the airy citadel<br />
O'erlooks the purging landscape's swell!<br />
Let not unto the stones the Day<br />
Her lily and rose, her sea and land display.<br />
Read the celestial sign!<br />
Lo! the South answers to the north;<br />
Bookworm break this sloth urbane;<br />
A greater spirit bids thee forth,<br />
Than the gray dreams which thee detain.<br />
Mark how the climbing Oreads<br />
Beckon thee to their arcades!<br />
Youth, for a moment free as they,<br />
Teach thy feet to feel the ground,<br />
Ere yet arrive the wintry day<br />
When Time thy feet has bound.<br />
Accept the bounty of thy birth;<br />
Taste the lordship of the earth."
</p>
<p>
I heard, and I obeyed,&#151;<br />
Assured that he who made the claim,<br />
Well-known, but loving not a name,<br />
Was not to be gainsaid.
</p>
<p>
Ere yet the summoning voice was still,<br />
I turned to Cheshire's haughty hill.<br />
From the fixed cone the cloud-rack flowed,<br />
Like ample banner flung abroad<br />
Round about, a hundred miles,<br />
With invitations to the sea, and to the bordering isles.
</p>
<p>
In his own loom's garment dressed,<br />
By his own bounty blessed,<br />
Fast abides this constant giver,<br />
Pouring many a cheerful river;<br />
To far eyes, an aerial isle,<br />
Unploughed, which finer spirits pile,<br />
Which morn and crimson evening paint<br />
For bard, for lover, and for saint;<br />
The country's core,<br />
Inspirer, prophet evermore;<br />
Pillar which God aloft had set<br />
So that men might it not forget,<br />
It should be their life's ornament,<br />
And mix itself with each event;<br />
Their calendar and dial,<br />
Barometer and chemic phial,<br />
Garden of berries, perch of birds,<br />
Pasture of pool-haunting herds,<br />
Graced by each change of sum untold,<br />
Earth-baking heat, stone-cleaving cold.
</p>
<p>
The Titan heeds his own affairs,<br />
Wide rents and high alliance shares;<br />
Mysteries of color daily laid<br />
By the great sun in light and shade,<br />
And sweet varieties of chance,<br />
And the mystic seasons' dance;<br />
And thief-like step of liberal hours<br />
Thawing the snow-drift into flowers.<br />
O, wondrous craft of plant and stone<br />
By eldest science done and shown!
</p>
<p>
"Happy," I said, "whose home is here,<br />
Fair fortunes to the mountaineer!<br />
Boon Nature to his poorest shed<br />
Has royal pleasure-grounds outspread."<br />
Intent, I searched the region round,<br />
And in low hut my monarch found.<br />
He was no eagle and no earl;&#151;<br />
Alas! my foundling was a churl,<br />
With heart of cat and eyes of bug,<br />
Dull victim of his pipe and mug.<br />
Woe is me for my hopes' downfall!<br />
Lord! is yon squalid peasant all<br />
That this proud nursery could breed<br />
For God's vicegerency and stead?<br />
Time out of mind, this forge of ores,<br />
Quarry of spars in mountain pores;<br />
Old cradle, hunting ground, and bier<br />
Of wolf and otter, bear and deer;<br />
Well-built abode of many a race;<br />
Tower of observance searching space;<br />
Factory of river and of rain;<br />
Link in the alps' globe-girding chain;<br />
By million changes skilled to tell<br />
What in the Eternal standeth well,<br />
And what obedient Nature can;&#151;<br />
Is this colossal talisman<br />
Kindly to creature, blood, and kind,<br />
And speechless to the master's mind?<br />
I thought to find the patriots<br />
In whom the stock of freedom roots:<br />
To myself I oft recount<br />
Tales of many a famous mount,&#151;<br />
Wales, Scotland, Uri, Hungary's dells;<br />
Roys, and Scanderbegs, and Tells.<br />
Here shall nature condense her powers,<br />
Her music, and her meteors,<br />
And, lifting man to the blue deep<br />
Where stars their perfect courses keep,<br />
Like wise perceptor lure his eye<br />
To sound the science of the sky,<br />
And carry learning to its height<br />
Of untried power and sane delight:<br />
The Indian cheer, the frosty skies,<br />
Breed purer wits, inventive eyes,&#151;<br />
Eyes that frame cities where none be,<br />
And hands that stablish what these see;<br />
And, by the moral of his place,<br />
Hint summits of heroic grace;<br />
Man in these crags a fastness find<br />
To fight pollution of the mind;<br />
In the wide thaw and ooze of wrong,<br />
Adhere like this foundation strong,<br />
The insanity of towns to stem<br />
With simpleness for stratagem.<br />
But if brave old mould is broke,<br />
And end in churls the mountain folk,<br />
In tavern cheer and tavern joke,&#151;<br />
Sink, O mountain, in the swamp!<br />
Hide in thy skies, O sovereign lamp!<br />
Perish like leaves, the highland breed!<br />
No sire survive, no son succeed!
</p>
<p>
Soft! let not the offended muse<br />
Toil's hard hap with scorn accuse.<br />
Many hamlets sought I then,<br />
Many farms of mountain men;<br />
Found I not a minstrel seed,<br />
But men of bone, and good at need.<br />
Rallying round a parish steeple<br />
Nestle warm the highland people,<br />
Course and boisterous, yet mild,<br />
Strong as giant, slow as child,<br />
Smoking in a squalid room,<br />
Where yet the westland breezes come.<br />
Close hid in those rough guises lurk<br />
Western magicians &#151; here they work.<br />
Sweat and season are their arts,<br />
Their talismans are ploughs and carts;<br />
And well the youngest can command<br />
Honey from the frozen land;<br />
With sweet hay the wild swamp adorn,<br />
Change the running sand to corn;<br />
For wolves and foxes, lowing herds,<br />
And for cold mosses, cream and curds;<br />
Weave wood to canisters and mats;<br />
Drain sweet maple-juice in vats.<br />
No bird is safe that cuts the air<br />
From their rifle or their snare;<br />
No fish, in river or in lake,<br />
But their long hands it thence will take;<br />
And the country's iron face,<br />
Like wax, their fashioning skill betrays,<br />
To fill the hollows, sink the hills,<br />
Bridge gulfs, drain swamps, build dams and mills,<br />
And fit the bleak and howling place<br />
For gardens of a finer race.<br />
The World-soul knows his own affair,<br />
Forelooking, when his hands prepare<br />
For the next ages, men of mould,<br />
Well embodied, well ensouled,<br />
He cools the present's fiery glow,<br />
Sets the life-pulse strong but slow:<br />
Bitter winds and fasts austere<br />
His quarantines and grottos, where<br />
He slowly cures decrepit flesh,<br />
And brings it infantile and fresh.<br />
These exercises are the toys<br />
And games with which he breathes his boys:<br />
They bide their time, and well can prove,<br />
If need were, their line from Jove;<br />
Of the same stuff, and so allayed,<br />
As that whereof the sun is made,<br />
And of that fibre, quick and strong,<br />
Whose throbs are love, whose thrills are song.
</p>
<p>
Now in sordid weeds they sleep,<br />
Their secret now in dulness keep;<br />
Yet, will you learn our ancient speech,<br />
These the masters who can teach.<br />
Fourscore or a hundred words<br />
All their vocal muse affords;<br />
These they turn in other fashion<br />
Than the writer or the parson.<br />
I can spare the college-bell,<br />
And the learned lecture, well;<br />
Spare the clergy and libraries,<br />
Institutes and dictionaries,<br />
For the hardy English root<br />
Thrives here, unvalued, underfoot.<br />
Rude poets of the tavern hearth,<br />
Squandering your unquoted mirth,<br />
Which keeps the ground, and never soars,<br />
While Jake retorts, and Reuben roars;<br />
Tough and screaming, as birch-bark,<br />
Goes like a bullet to its mark,<br />
While the solid curse and jeer<br />
Never balk the waiting ear.<br />
To student ears the keen relished jokes<br />
On truck, and stock, and farming-folks,&#151;<br />
Nought the mountain yields thereof<br />
But savage health and sinews tough.
</p>
<p>
On the summit as I stood,<br />
O'er the wide floor of plain and flood,<br />
Seemed to me, the towering hill<br />
Was not altogether still,<br />
But a quiet sense conveyed;<br />
If I err not, thus it said:&#151;
</p>
<p>
"Many feet in summer seek,<br />
Betimes, my far-appearing peak;<br />
In the dreaded winter time,<br />
None save dappling shadows climb,<br />
Under clouds, my lonely head,<br />
Old as the sun, old almost as the shade.<br />
And comest thou<br />
To see strange forests and new snow,<br />
And tread uplifted land?<br />
And leavest thou thy lowland race,<br />
Here amid clouds to stand?<br />
And would'st be my companion,<br />
Where I gaze,<br />
And shall gaze,<br />
When forests fall, and man is gone,<br />
Over tribes and over times,<br />
As the burning Lyre,<br />
Nearing me,<br />
With its stars of northern fire,<br />
In many a thousand years?
</p>
<p>
"Ah! welcome, if thou bring<br />
My secret in my brain;<br />
To mountain-top may Muse's wing<br />
With good allowance strain.<br />
Gentle pilgrim, if though know<br />
The gamut old of Pan,<br />
And how the hills began,<br />
The frank blessings of the hill<br />
Fall on thee, as fall they will.<br />
'Tis the law of bush and stone,<br />
Each can only take his own.
</p>
<p>
"Let him heed who can and will;<br />
Enchantment fixed me here<br />
To stand the hurts of time, until<br />
In mightier chant I disappear.<br />
If thou trowest<br />
How the chemic eddies play,<br />
Pole to pole, and what they say;<br />
And that these gray crags<br />
Not on crags are hung,<br />
But beads are of a rosary<br />
On prayer and music strung;<br />
And, credulous, through the granite seeming,<br />
Seest the smile of Reason beaming;&#151<br />
Can thy style-discerning eye<br />
The hidden-working Builder spy,<br />
Who builds, yet makes no chips, no din,<br />
With hammer soft as snowflake's flight;&#151;<br />
Knowest thou this?<br />
O pilgrim, wandering not amiss!<br />
Already my rocks lie light,<br />
And soon my cone will spin.
</p>
<p>
"For the world was built in order,<br />
And the atoms march in tune;<br />
Rhyme the pipe, and Time the warder,<br />
Cannot forget the sun, the moon.<br />
Orb and atom forth they prance,<br />
When they hear from far the rune;<br />
None so backward in the troop,<br />
When the music and the dance<br />
Reach his place and circumstance,<br />
But knows the sun-creating sound,<br />
And, though a pyramid, will bound.
</p>
<p>
"Monadnoc is a mountain strong,<br />
Tall and good my kind among;<br />
But well I know, no mountain can<br />
Measure with a perfect man.<br />
For it is on temples writ,<br />
Adamant is soft to wit:<br />
And when the greater comes again<br />
With my secret in his brain,<br />
I shall pass, as glides my shadow<br />
Daily over hill and meadow.
</p>
<p>
"Through all time,<br />
I heard the approaching feet<br />
Along the flinty pathway beat<br />
Of him that cometh, and shall come;<br />
Of him who shall as lightly bear<br />
My daily load of woods and streams,<br />
As doth this round sky-cleaving boat<br />
Which never strains its rocky beams;<br />
Whose timbers, as they silent float,<br />
Alps and Caucasus uprear,<br />
And the long Alleghanies here,<br />
And all town-sprinkled lands that be,<br />
Sailing through stars with all their history.
</p>
<p>
"Every morn I lift my head,<br />
Gaze o'er New England underspread,<br />
South from Saint Lawrence to the Sound,<br />
From Katskill east to the sea-bound.<br />
Anchored fast for many an age,<br />
I await the bard and sage,<br />
Who, in large thoughts, like fair pearl-seed,<br />
Shall string Monadnoc like a bead.<br />
Comes that cheerful troubadour,<br />
This mound shall throb his face before,<br />
As when, with inward fires and pain,<br />
It rose a bubble from the plain.<br />
When he cometh, I shall shed,<br />
From this wellspring in my head,<br />
Fountain drop of spicier worth<br />
Than all the vintage of the earth.<br />
There's fruit upon my barren soil<br />
Costlier far than wine or oil.<br />
There's a berry blue and gold,&#151;<br />
Autumn-ripe, its juices hold<br />
Sparta's stoutness, Bethlehem's heart,<br />
Asia's rancor, Athens' art,<br />
Slowsure Britain's secular might,<br />
And the German's inward sight.<br />
I will give my son to eat<br />
Best of Pan's immortal meat,<br />
Bread to eat, and juice to drink;<br />
So the thoughts that he shall think<br />
Shall not be forms of stars, but stars,<br />
Nor pictures pale, but Jove and Mars.<br />
He comes, but not of that race bred<br />
Who daily climb my specular head.<br />
Oft as morning wreathes my scarf,<br />
Fled the last plumule of the Dark,<br />
Pants up hither the spruce clerk<br />
From South Cove and City Wharf.<br />
I take him up my ragged sides,<br />
Half-repentant, scant of breath,&#151;<br />
Bead-eyes my granite chaos show,<br />
And my midsummer snow;<br />
Open the daunting map beneath,&#151;<br />
All his county, sea and land,<br />
Dwarf to measure of his hand;<br />
His day's ride is a furlong space,<br />
His city tops a glimmering haze.<br />
I plant his eye on the sky-hoop bounding:<br />
"See there the grim gray rounding<br />
Of the bullet of the earth<br />
Whereon ye sail,<br />
Tumbling steep<br />
In the uncontinented deep."<br />
He looks on that, and he turns pale.<br />
"'Tis even so; this treacherous kite,<br />
Farm-furrowed, town-incrusted sphere,<br />
Thoughtless of its anxious freight,<br />
Plunges eyeless on forever;<br />
And he, poor parasite,<br />
Cooped in a ship he cannot steer,<br />
Who is the captain he knows not,<br />
Port or pilot trows not,&#151;<br />
Risk or ruin he must share.<br />
I scowl on him with my cloud,<br />
With my north wind chill his blood;<br />
I lame him, clattering down the rocks;<br />
And to live he is in fear.<br />
Then, at last, I let him down<br />
Once more into his dapper town,<br />
To chatter, frightened, to his clan,<br />
And forget me, if he can."
</p>
<p>
As in the old poetic fame<br />
The gods are blind and lame,<br />
And the simular despite<br />
Betrays the more abounding might,<br />
So call not waste that barren cone<br />
Above the floral zone,<br />
Where forests starve:<br />
It is pure use;<br />
What sheaves like those which here we glean and bind<br />
Of a celestial Ceres and the Muse?
</p>
<p>
Ages are thy days,<br />
Thou grand expressor of the present tense,<br />
And type of permanence!<br />
Firm ensign of the fatal Being,<br />
Amid these coward shapes of joy and grief,<br />
That will not bide the seeing!
</p>
<p>
Hither we bring<br />
Our insect miseries to the rocks;<br />
And the whole flight with pestering wing<br />
Vanish, and end their murmuring,&#151;<br />
Vanish beside these dedicated blocks,<br />
Which; who can tell what mason laid?<br />
Spoils of a front none need restore,<br />
Replacing frieze and architrave;<br />
Yet flowers each stone rosette and metope brave;<br />
Still is the haughty pile erect<br />
Of the old building Intellect.
</p>
<p>
Complement of human kind,<br />
Having us at vantage still,<br />
Our sumptuous indigence,<br />
O barren mound, thy plenties fill!<br />
We fool and prate;<br />
Thou art silent and sedate.<br />
To million kinds and times one sense<br />
The constant mountain both dispense;<br />
Shedding on all its snows and leaves,<br />
One joy it joys, one grief it grieves.<br />
Thou seest, O watchman tall,<br />
Our towns and races grow and fall,<br />
And imagest the stable good<br />
For which we all our lifetime grope,<br />
In shifting form the formless mind,<br />
And though the substance us elude,<br />
We in thee the shadow find.<br />
Thou, in our astronomy<br />
An opaker star,<br />
Seen haply from afar,<br />
Above the horizon's hoop,<br />
A moment, by the railway troop,<br />
As o'er some bolder height they speed,&#151;<br />
By circumspect ambition,<br />
By errant gain,<br />
By feasters, and the frivolous,&#151;<br />
Recallest us,<br />
And makest sane.<br />
Mute orator! well skilled to plead,<br />
And send conviction without phrase,<br />
Thou dost supply<br />
The shortness of our days,<br />
And promise, on thy Founder's truth,<br />
Long morrow to this mortal youth.
</p>

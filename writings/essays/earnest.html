<h2>Living in Earnest: Kurt Keefner's Concrete Ethics</h2>
<h3>Review of Killing Cool: Fantasy vs. Reality in American Life</h3>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre (2015)</h3>

<hr/>

<p>Kurt Keefner's <cite>Killing Cool: Fantasy vs. Reality in American Life</cite> often feels like three books in one: a positive ethics of the good life, wrapped inside a psychological analysis of some common deviations from reality, wrapped inside searching criticism of contemporary American culture. Cutting to the essence, this review focuses on the philosophical core of Keefner's work, which he calls "concrete ethics" and characterizes as "an ethics that goes beyond general virtues and deals with the specific habits necessary to live the good life" (5).</p>
<p>Keefner sets the context for concrete ethics by observing that what is needed today is a philosophy for living in a market-based society. Indeed, older ways of life such as that of the starving artist, aristocratic patron, or spiritual hermit have been dissolved by the market into economic roles such as the creative entrepreneur, venture philanthropist, and freelance counselor. At least in the developed world, we are all middle-class capitalists now.</p>
<p>Yet traditional and contemporary academic approaches to ethics provide little guidance for navigating this brave new world. At their best, they emphasize some of the virtues that are needed to live a good human life. However, they were developed at a time when the centrality of work was not yet recognized or was actively frowned upon (as in classical Greece). Even relatively recent philosophers that Keefner cites, such as Nietzsche and Rand, might have talked about work but in their own lives were still lone writers with limited experience of the workaday world.</p>
<p>In Keefner's view, the best strategy for living a good life in modern society is to consciously improve one's character and develop one's values in the wider context of a plan for doing something interesting and important with one's time and talents. Such a strategy involves and requires many significant virtues: reasoned reflection, self-awareness, moral commitment and ambition, hard work, common sense, practicality, seriousness or earnestness, thinking and acting long term, creativity, authenticity, active engagement with the world and active realization of one's potential.</p>
<p>The core of Keefner's concrete ethics is recognizably Aristotelian or classical: it is an ethics of self-knowledge and self-realization. Indeed, his phrase "become who you are" (63), also quoted approvingly by Nietzsche, comes ultimately from a fragment of Pindar ("become what you are, having learned what that is"). Yet Keefner brings that ancient ethos into the modern world by applying it to the practical challenges of living under capitalism.</p>
<p>One of the deepest challenges is that capitalism, at least as it has developed in America, goes hand in hand with a shallow consumerism and, all too often, a lowest-common-denominator culture. These trends have been abetted first by radio, then by television, and more recently by the Internet. All of these technologies have contributed to a faster pace of human interaction, a less reflective approach to living, and increasingly a post-literate society.</p>
<p>Crucially, they have also led to a blurring of the lines between fantasy and reality....

<p>...</p>

<p>One might wish that the author had engaged more fully with past thinkers who have tried to develop secular foundations for living a good human life. To name a few: Aristotle on habits and reason and practical wisdom; Epicurus on serenity and ilving without fear; Adam Smith on compassion; Emerson on self-reliance; Thoreau on earnestness; Nietzsche on becoming who you are; Rand on purpose. Such engagement might have lent a greater depth to some of his observations and recommendations.</p>

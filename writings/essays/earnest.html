<h2>Living in Earnest: Kurt Keefner's Concrete Ethics</h2>
<h3>Review of Killing Cool: Fantasy vs. Reality in American Life</h3>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre (2015)</h3>

<hr/>

<p>Kurt Keefner's <cite>Killing Cool: Fantasy vs. Reality in American Life</cite> often feels like three books in one: a positive ethics of the good life, wrapped inside a psychological analysis of some common deviations from reality, wrapped inside a searching criticism of contemporary American culture. Cutting to the essence, this review focuses on the philosophical core of Keefner's work, which he calls "concrete ethics" and characterizes as "an ethics that goes beyond general virtues and deals with the specific habits necessary to live the good life" (5).</p>
<p>Keefner sets the context for his concrete ethics by observing that what is needed today is a philosophy for living in a market-based society. Older and other ways of life such as that of the starving artist, aristocratic patron, or spiritual hermit have been dissolved by the market into economic roles such as that of the creative entrepreneur, venture philanthropist, and freelance counselor. At least in the developed world, in some sense we are all middle-class capitalists now.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, traditional and contemporary academic approaches to ethics provide little guidance for navigating this brave new world. At their best, they emphasize some of the virtues that are needed to live a good human life in any place and time. However, they were developed at a time when the centrality of work was not yet recognized or was actively frowned upon (as in classical Greece). Even relatively recent philosophers that Keefner cites, such as Nietzsche and Rand, might have talked about work but in their own lives were still lone writers with limited experience of the workaday world.</p>
<p>In Keefner's view, the best strategy for living a good life in modern society is to consciously improve one's character and develop one's values in the wider context of a plan for doing something interesting and important with one's time and talents. Such a strategy involves and requires significant virtues: reasoned reflection, self-awareness, moral ambition, hard work, common sense, practicality, commitment to human relationships, compassion, earnestness, thinking and acting long term, creativity, authenticity, active engagement with the world and active realization of one's potential.</p>
<p>Thus the core of Keefner's concrete ethics is recognizably Aristotelian or classical: it is an ethics of self-knowledge and self-realization. Indeed, his phrase "become who you are" (63), also quoted approvingly by Nietzsche, comes ultimately from a fragment of Pindar ("become what you are, having learned what that is"). Yet Keefner brings that ancient ethos into the modern world by applying it to the practical challenges of living under capitalism.</p>
<p>One of the deepest challenges is that the market economy, at least as it has developed in America, usually goes hand in hand with a shallow consumerism and, all too often, a lowest-common-denominator culture. These phenomena have been abetted by technology: first by radio, then by television, and more recently by the Internet. All of these technologies and their associated habits have contributed to a faster pace of human interaction, a less reflective approach to living, and, increasingly, a post-literate society in which individuals are easily manipulated by imagery, advertising, and propaganda of one form or another.</p>
<p>Crucially, these trends have led to a blurring of the lines between fantasy and reality. On Keefner's account, the resulting confusion points in the direction, not of considering stories as real, but of considering reality as a kind of story. People who he characterizes as "pretenders" feel the need to project a mood or style onto reality, their lives, and their interactions with other people. Whether they are macho or sweet or natural or cool, they treat reality as an extension of the self, not as an independent realm of exploration and action. Importantly, they also treat other people as means to their emotional ends or even as entertainment, not as fully human beings deserving of compassion and respect.</p>
<p>The ultimate remedy for this fundamental confusion is captured by a principle that Keefner borrows from Ayn Rand: the primacy of existence (223-230). Fittingly, he gives it a distinctively ethical slant by emphasizing the importance of going out to meet the world (including other people) on its terms, of gaining a true sense of self through active engagement in projects and relationships. What he terms "mature wonder" (62-64) is not just a feeling or an attitude, but a positive choice to perceive anew, to become aware of the world as it is, and to realize one's full potential.</p>
<p>Keefner melds the primacy of existence with two additional habits of thought and action: focusing (211-215) and centering (216-223). Focusing, a concept originally developed by philosopher Eugene Gendlin, consists of coming to an explicit understanding of one's implicit impressions and thus enables one to comprehend one's emotional reactions and evaluations as authentic and serious indicators of one's values. Centering, a method of Keefner's own synthesis from several sources, helps one to become more deeply aware of and engaged with oneself, other people, and the world - not in the passive sense of receptivity but in the active sense of causing oneself to be aware of and present in one's interactions.</p>
<p>These three primary habits of focusing, centering, and embracing reality provide the foundation, on Keefner's account, for living as a real self in the real world (232), for creating a life of substance over style, being over seeming, and personal excellence over the pursuit of power, charisma, or status (160-161).</p>
<p>Thus does Keefner invest what some might call an essentially bourgeois way of life with a kind of simple grandeur. The psychological needs for a sense of independence, self-worth, creativity, serenity, and even grace can be met without trying to be cool or exciting or superior, but by developing one's full humanity (122) and tutoring one's innate desires into full maturity (91, 97). Instead of sticking it to the bourgeoisie, Keefner counsels one to find what is valuable in the bourgeois way of life (140) and to take advantage of the opportunities it affords.</p>
<p>However, his is not a creed of complacency. He gently exhorts the reader to do something significant with one's life, to build soemthing of value, to achieve a timeless quality in oneself and one's tastes. And he is not afraid to find fault with countless contemporary phenomena that most people take for granted.</p>
<p>Naturally, it is an occupational hazard of the cultural critic that turning attention to the particulars of current movements can alienate readers who do not share the critic's personal preferences with regard to art, culture, and (these days) technology. The author of <cite>Killing Cool</cite> is no exception in this regard. Rather than catalogue the points on which he and I diverge, I would suggest something of an antidote: being more philosophical. I feel that the author could have engaged more fully with past philosophers who have labored to develop secular foundations for living a good human life. To name a few: Aristotle on habits and reason and practical wisdom; Epicurus on serenity and living without fear; Adam Smith on sympathy and compassion; Emerson on self-improvement; Thoreau on earnestness and independence; Nietzsche on becoming who you are; Rand on purpose and productiveness; Pierre Hadot on philosophical practices. Such engagement would lend a greater depth to the helpfully concrete observations and recommendations that Keefner provides throughout his analysis. We can hope that this is a direction that Keefner or likeminded individuals will pursue in future work.</p>
<p>Quibbles aside, I would submit that Keefner has created a valuable and broadly Aristotelian addition to solutions for the problem of living in the modern world. In contrast to distant ideals such as Aristotle's great-souled man, Nietzsche's Ã¼bermensch, or Rand's symbolic heroes, Keefner paints the picture of a greatness that is attainable by normal people given the opportunities and constraints of present-day society. That alone makes <cite>Killing Cool</cite> well worth reading and reflecting upon.</p>

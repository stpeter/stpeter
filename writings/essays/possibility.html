<h2>The Possibility of Anarchism</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>In <cite>The Facts of Reality</cite>, Nicholas Dykes has provided, to my mind, the most thorough and approachable argument for anarchism yet presented to those in the Randian tradition. Here I would like to expand and comment upon some themes in his essay to bring them into sharper relief.</p>
<p><cite>The Facts of Reality</cite> admirably combines historical evidence with philosophical analysis. However, on several points I think that Dykes potentially undercuts his argument. For instance, he claims that "since all governments were established by force for the purpose of exploiting subject peoples, protecting rights never has been, and never could be, part of their remit" (107) and that "[c]learly, a monopoly established by force and supporting itself by expropriation cannot be a rights protector" (ibid.). These are strong claims &mdash in my opinion, unnecessarily strong. We don't need to claim that no state ever has or ever could engage in even one instance of protecting a right in order to show that in general a society characterized by completely voluntary relations is or would be superior to a society that over which a state holds sway. All we need to show is that stateless societies in the past (and even the present) have protected individual rights and have done so to a greater degree than governments have.</p>
<p>Dykes's essay might lead one to paraphrase the title of a book by Robert Hessen: "why does the state continue to appeal to anyone?" Dykes and Larry Sechrest offer some clues, but I don't think they go far enough. It is not just that stateless societies are unfamiliar; it is that they are unappealing. The modern, technological societies we're accustomed to have states, whereas the tribal, kinship-based examples of stateless societies didn't or don't have all our modern conveniences. This leads people to associate states with modernity. So I think a great deal of the challenge for those who would argue for a fully voluntary society is to show not the existence of pre-state societies but the possibility of post-state societies.</p>
<p>This is not an easy task. Science fiction writers have tried their hand at it, but I think historians and philosophers can join in the effort, as well. Now, historians are famously loath to engage in speculation about the future, and justifiably so. But it is only by clearly understanding historical processes and (most particularly) societal evolution that we can try to glimpse, however haltingly, into the future.</p>
<p>As a point of departure, let us look at the model of societal evolution presented by David Ronfeldt in his essay "Tribes, Institutions, Markets, Networks" (TIMN). In brief, Ronfeldt argues that human societies have become ever more complex over time, in large measure because they have opened up avenues for different kinds of relationships and organizations. Thus the simplest societies are based only on kinship ties, and human societies for tens of thousands years were organized only into bands, tribes, clans, and other kinship groups. With the switch from hunting and gathering to agriculture around ten thousand years ago, societies needed to plan more for the future and began to produce surpluses; thus emerged those who would organize large-scale work and control the surpluses, giving great power to hierarchical institutions such as governments and religions. As powerful trading and then producing organizations have emerged over the last one thousand years, market-oriented societies gained strength through Western civilization and more recently in eastern Asia. Finally, in the last fifty years or so, networks of non-commerical, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have begun to gain strength in the most advanced societies, leading to the potential for an ever stronger "social sector" (Drucker).</p>
<p>In Ronfeldt's TIMN model, these levels are evolutionary and additive: the simplest societies are "T" societies in which most all of life happens in the context of a tribe or other kinship group; more complex societies layer hierarchical institutions over the tribal substrate and thus are T+I societies; still more complex societies add a strong market sector and thus are T+I+M societies; and finally we may be witnessing the emergence of voluntary networks as a fourth important sector in T+I+M+N societies.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of the TIMN model is that adding a layer does not make a prior level obsolete. States did not destroy kinship bonds and markets did not destroy states. On the contrary, the emergence of states removed many responsibilities from kinship groups (law, defense, food production) but strengthened the hold of families in their remaining areas of focus (identity, sociality, and the like); similarly, the emergence of strong markets removed many responsibilties from states (banking, trading, etc.) but strengthened the state in its core competencies (especially law and defense).</p>
<p>While this account seems to capture much of the existing scholarly consensus about how societal evolution has played out, it's not clear to me that it is <cite>true</cite>. For one, trading is perhaps one of the primal human activities (note); for another, informal networks of organizations cooperated for centuries before NGOs gained prominence. But something like the TIMN model seems to capture what people think has happened over the last ten thousand years.</p>
<p>Thus even if libertarian anarchists can show that a T society can be stateless, people in advanced TIM or TIMN societies might not care. And that's exactly what we see in the Objectivist reaction to historical arguments such as those provided by Nicholas Dykes. Most of the evidence adduced is from kinship-based societies in which dispute resolution is performed by tribal elders or local wise men. (The Law Merchant is an interesting exception, as I'll discuss below.) And Objectivists are not particularly interested in returning to T societies, since such societies are not only pre-technical but pre-individualist (I purposely do not say anti-individualist, since individualism too has evolved &mdash though we know that Objectivist views about kinship ties are, to say the least, undeveloped).</p>
<p>Given that pre-state societies are unappealing, I think we need to envision how a post-state society might emerge. My record of prognostication is no better than anyone else's, so I consider my contribution to be at best the start of a conversation.</p>
<p>First, even politics is in the broadest sense a technology: that is, a tool for human living. If an existing political structure or social order does not serve human needs, we can develop something better. So part of the task facing market anarchists is to show how polycentric, voluntary law would be a "technological" improvement over statism. There are several features of market anarchism that might make it appealing (to some). It would be a kind of capitalism, and in a capitalist economy businesses exist to serve the needs of consumers, not the other way around. Presumably consumer-oriented businesses would spring up to offer services related to personal security, property protection, mediation and arbitration, and so on. (In fact, many companies and individuals already offer such services all over the world.) Standardization efforts would emerge in law (e.g., the definition of contracts) just as they have over the last 150 years in most fields of technology, medicine, and the like. These phenomena would apply and extend what we have learned in the advanced market societies over the last five hundred years. And they would apply it to a society that is characterized by ever more rapid technological and societal change. Indeed, market-driven law and quite possibly other network-driven cooperative structures may be precisely what is needed to flexibly respond to rapid and radical change, whereas the legislative law of state-led societies is simply too slow to adapt. Perhaps state-made, legislative law was the best that human beings could do at a certain stage of human societal evolution but it has outlived its usefulness; now a more dynamic, polycentric legal order based on market mechanisms is appropriate.</p>
<p>So much for the "M" of a TIMN society. Another challenge is a kind of societal scaling. Mechanisms and structures that worked in bands and tribes (in which everyone knew everyone else) simply do not scale to modern society (in which we are reaching the point that no one knows anyone else). Customary law worked in Anglo-Saxon society because the units of societal organization were tithes ("tenths") and hundreds. The Law Merchant worked because the late medieval European trading community in which it emerged was small enough that reputational effects and the threat of ostracism could work their magic (plus the judges were themselves merchants and therefore inside rather than outside the system). Analogous mechanisms for self-policing can and do work in smaller communities within modern society &mdash from worldwide business and technical organizations in particular fields to homeowners associations and neighborhood groups in particular localities. But it is hard to scale them in a general fashion. So part of what may be needed in order to develop a viable post-state society is a devolution of power and decision-making to voluntary associations of individuals that are as close as possible to what Friedrich Hayek called "the particular circumstances of time and place" (as for instance early Anglo-Saxon juries were: a jury of one's peers was normally a group of one's neighbors or even of the witnesses to and participants in the incident being adjudicated). Such small, flexible networks may well be able to supplement and work with the market-oriented mechanisms adumbrated above.</p>
<p>These speculations are merely that. There is no guarantee that such flexible, voluntary orders will come to be, or that states would allow them to flourish. But one advantage they have is that they are by nature decentralized. Centralized solutions to the development of a polycentric legal order and fully voluntary society are nearly a contradiction in terms. Furthermore, they are brittle rather than robust, artificial rather than organic, rules rather than habits. Even if tomorrow market anarchists were to somehow gain control over the levers of power only to destroy the state, present-day individuals, companies, and networks would not be ready for a fully voluntary society. And such a reversal of fortune is a fantasy anyway. In point of fact, it is as unlikely that a fully voluntary society could emerge today as it was that a market-driven (T+I+M) society could have emerged in 5,000 BCE or that a state-led (T+I) society could have emerged in 50,000 BCE.</p>
<p>Ronfeldt connects political forms with societal and technological complexity. One great hope for a post-state society may be the consistently and rapidly increasing pace of change in the advanced countries of the world today. These changes are often linked to the so-called "Singularity revolutions" happening in information technology, genetic medicine, robotics, and molecular engineering (to name just a few). Before too long, change may happen so fast that legislators and bureaucrats simply will not be able to keep pace, whereas more flexible companies and networks will.</p>
<p>What is the role of philosophy in all this? Nicholas Dykes makes the intriguing observation that "quote". I happen to think that traditional philosophy, too, may not be able to keep pace. What matters going forward is not abstract arguments but workable "technologies" of social practice. Taking years or decades to work out a detailed treatise on the philosophical foundations of a fully voluntary society may be interesting and important in the long haul, but there will also be many opportunities for those of a philosophical bent to get involved in efforts such as legal standardization.</p>

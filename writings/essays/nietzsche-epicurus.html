<blockquote>
<p>I profit from a philosopher only insofar as he can be an example. That he is capable of drawing whole nations after him through this example is beyond doubt; the history of India, which is almost the history of Indian philosophy, proves it. But this example must be supplied by his outward life and not merely in his books -- in the way, that is, in which the philosophers of Greece taught, through their bearing, what they wore and ate, and their morals, rather than by what they said, let alone by what they wrote.  <br />--<cite>Section 3</cite></p>

<p>[Schopenhauer] teaches us to distinguish between those things that really promote human happiness and those that only appear to do so: how neither riches nor honors nor erudition can lift the individual out of the profound depression he feels at the valuelessness of his existence, and how the striving after these valued things acquires meaning only through an exalted and transfiguring overall goal: to acquire power so as to aid the evolution of the <em>physis</em> and to be for a while the corrector of its follies and ineptitudes. At first only for yourself, to be sure; but through yourself in the end for everyone.  <br />--<cite>Section 3</cite></p>

<p>Even today many educated people think that the victory of Christianity over Greek philosophy is a proof of the superior truth of the former -- although in this case it was only the coarser and more violent that conquered the more spiritual and delicate. So far as superior truth is concerned, it it enough to observe that the awakening sciences have allied themselves point by point with the philosophy of Epicurus but point by point rejected Christianity.  <br />--<cite>Section 68</cite></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Cynic and Epicurean.</em> -- The Cynic recognizes the connection between the augmented and enhanced sufferings of the more highly cultivated man and the abundance of his needs; he grasps, that is to say, that the host of opinions that exists as regards the beautiful, appropriate, becoming, pleasurable must give rise not only to sources of enjoyment but also of repugnance. In accordance with this insight he reverses his development, inasmuch as he gives up many of these opinions and evades certain of the demands of culture; he therewith gains a feeling of freedom and invigoration, and, once habit has rendered his mode of life endurable to him, he gradually in fact comes to feel sensations of repugnance less often and less acutely, and to approach the condition of the domestic animal; in addition, however, he feels that all lies in the charm of contrast and can in any event scold and grumble to his heart's content: so that in this way he again raises himself high above the world of sensations of the animal. -- The Epicurean has the same viewpoint as the Cynic; between the two there usually exists only a difference of temperament. The Epicurean likewise employs his higher culture to make himself independent of dominating opinions; only he lists himself above them, while the Cynic remains at the stage of negation. It is as though he wanders along still, sheltered, twilight pathways, while above him the tops of the trees whirl about in the wind and betray to him how violently buffetted the world outside is. In the case of the Cynic, on the other hand, it is as though he walks abroad naked in the teeth of the wind and hardens himself to the point of feeling nothing.  <br />--<cite>Section 275</cite></p>

<p><em>Modern restlessness.</em> -- Mordern agitatedness grows greater the farther west we go, so that to the Americans the inhabitants of Europe seem one and all ease-loving and epicurean creatures, though in fact they are swarming among one another like bees and wasps. This agitatedness is growing so great that higher culture can no longer allow its fruits to mature; it is as though the seasons were following upon one another too quickly. From lack of repose our civilization is turning into a new barbarism. At no time have the active, that is to say the restless, counted for more. That is why one of the more necessary corrections to the character of mankind that have to be taken in hand is a considerable strengthening of the contemplative element in it. Yet even now every individual who is calm and steady in head and heart has the right to believe not only that he has a good temperament, but also that he is in possession of a universally useful virtue and even that, by preserving this virtue, he is fulfilling a higher task.  <br />--<cite>Section 285</cite></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Prudence of free spirits.</em> -- The liberal-minded -- men who live for the sake of knowledge alone -- will find they soon attain the external goal of their life, their definitive position in relation to society and the state, and will easily be content with, for example, a minor office or an income that just enables them to live; for they will organize their life in such a way that a great transformation of external circumstances, even an overturning of the political order, does not overturn their life along with it. Upon all these things they expend as little energy as possible, so that they may dive down into the element of knowledge with all their accumulated strength and as it were with a deep breath. Thus they may hope to dive deep and perhaps get a view of the ground at the bottom. -- Of whatever happens to him such a spirit will want to appropriate only the tip; he has no love for things in their entirety, in all the breadth and prolixity of their convolutions, for he has no wish to get himself entangled with them. -- He too knows the weekdays of unfreedom, of dependence, of servitude. But from time to time he has to have a Sunday of freedom, or he will find life unendurable. -- It is probably that even his love for other people will be prudent and somewhat short-breathed, for he wants to become involved with the world of affection and blindess only insofar as it is necessary for acquiring knowledge. He must trust that the genius of justice will put in a word on behalf of his disciple and protege if accusing voices should call him poor in love. -- There is in his way of living and thinking a <em>refined heroism</em> that disdains to offer itself to the veneration of the great masses, as his coarser brother does, and tends to go silently through the world and out of the world. Whatever labyrinths he may stray through, among whatever rocks his stream may make its tortuous way -- if he emerges into the open air he will travel his road bright, light, and almost soundlessly, and let the sunshine play down into his very depths.

<p><em>Boredom and play.</em> -- Need compels us to perfom work with the proceeds of which the need is assuaged; need continually recurs and we are thus accustomed to working. In the intervals, however, during which our needs have been assuaged and are as it were sleeping, we are overtaken by boredom. What is this? It is our habituation to work as such, which now asserts itself as a new, additional need; and the more strongly habituated we are to working, perhaps even the more we have suffered need, the stronger this new need will be. To elude boredom man either works harder than is required to satisfy his other needs or he invents play, that is to say work designed to assuage no other need than the need for work as such. He who has become tired of play, and who has no fresh needs that require him to work, is sometimes overtaken by a longing for a third condition which stands in the same relation to play as floating does to dancing and dancing to walking -- for a state of serene agitation; it is the artist's and philosopher's vision of happiness.

<blockquote>
<p><em>Without melody.</em> -- There are people who repose so steadily within themselves and whose capacities are balanced with one another so harmoniously that any activity directed towards a goal is repugnant to them. They are like music that consists of nothing but long drawn out harmonious chords, without even the beginning of a moving, articulated melody making an appearance. Any movement from without serves only to settle the barque into a new equilibrium on the lake of harmonious euphony. Modern men usually grow extremely impatient when confronted by such natures, which <em>become</em> nothing without our being able to say they <em>are</em> nothing. But in certain moods the sight of them prompts the unusual question: why melody at all? Why does the quiet reflection of life in a deep lake not suffice us? -- The Middle Ages were richer in such natures than our age is. How seldom do we now encounter one able to live thus happily and peaceably with himself even in the turmoil of life, saying to himself with Goethe: "the best is the profound stillness towards the world in which I live and grow, and win for myself what they cannot take from me with fire and sword".

<p><em>Realized Christianity.</em> Even within Christianity there exists an Epicurean point of view: it proceeds from the idea that God could demand of man, his creature and likeness, only that which it is <em>possible</em> for the latter to accomplish, and that Christian virtue and perfection must therefore be achievable and frequently achived. Now, the <em>belief</em> that we <em>love</em> our enemy, for example -- even when it is only belief, fancy, and in no way a psychological reality (is not love, that is to say) -- undoubtedly makes us <em>happy</em> so long as it really is believed (why? as to that the psychologist and the Christian will, to be sure, think differently). And thus <em>earthly life</em> may, through the belief, I mean the fancy, that one has fulfilled not only the demand to love one's enemy but all other Christian demands as well, and has really appropriated and incorporated divine perfection according to the commandment "be ye perfect, as your Father in Heaven is perfect", in fact become a <em>life of bliss</em>. Error is thus able to make Christ's <em>promise</em> come true.  <br />--<cite>Section 96</cite></p>

<p><em>Balm and poison.</em> -- This fact can never be sufficiently pondered: Christianity is the religion of antiquity grown old, it presupposition is degenerated ancient cultures; on these it could and can act as a balm. In ages in which ears and eyes are "filled with mud", so that they are no longer capable of hearing the voice of reason and philosophy, or of seeing wisdom in bodily form, whether it bear the name of Epictetus or of Epicurus: in such ages the cross of martrydom and the "trumpet of the last judgment" may perhaps still move the peoples to live a <em>decent</em> life....  <br />--<cite>Section 224</cite></p>

<p><em>Descent into Hades.</em> -- I too have been in the underworld, like Odysseus, and will often be there again; and I have not only sacrificed rams to be able to talk with the dead, but have not spared my own blood as well. There have been four pairs who did not refuse themselves to me, the sacrificer: Epicurus and Montaigne, Goethe and Spinoza, Plato and Rousseau, Pascal and Schopenhauer. With these I have had to come to terms when I have wandered long alone, from them will I accept judgment, to them will I listen when in doing so they judge one another. Whatever I say, resolve, cogitate for myself and others: upon these eight I fix my eyes and see theirs fixed upon me. -- May the living forgive me if <em>they</em> sometimes appear to me as shades, so pale and ill-humoured, so restless and, alas, so lusting for life: whereas those others then seem to me so alive, as though now, <em>after</em> death, they could never again grow weary of life. <em>Eternal liveliness,</em> however, is what counts: what does "eternal life", or life at all, matter to us!  <br />--<cite>Section 408</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Human, All Too Human (Book II, Part 2)</h5>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Two means of consolation.</em> -- Epicurus, the soul-soother of later antiquity, had that wonderful insight, which is still today so rarely to be discovered, that to quieten the heart it is absolutely not necessary to have solved the ultimate and outermost theoretical questions. Thus to those tormented by "fear of the gods" it sufficed him to say: "if the gods exist they do not concern themselves with us" -- instead of indulging in fruitless and distant disputation over the ultimate question whether the gods do in fact exist. This position is much more favorable and much stronger: one gives the other a few steps advantage and thus makes him more willing to listen and ponder. As soon, however, as he sets about demonstrating the opposite -- that the gods do concern themselves with us -- into what wrong paths and thorny thickets the poor fellow must stray, entirely of his own volition and not through any cunning of his interlocutor, who needs only to possess sufficient humanity and subtley to conceal the pity he feels at this spectacle. At last this other will arrive at a feeling of disgust, the strongest argument against any proposition, disgust at his own assertion; he will cool down and depart in the same mood as that which characterizes the pure atheist: "what do the gods matter to me anyway! The devil take them!" -- In other instances, especially when some hypothesis belonging half to physics and half to morals had cast gloom over someone's spirits, he refrained from refuting this hypothesis and admitted it might well be true: but he added that there was <em>yet another</em> hypothesis to explain the same phenomenon; perhaps this second hypothesis represented the truth. A <em>multiplicity</em> of hypotheses, for example as to the origin of the bad conscience, suffices still in our own time to lift from the soul that shadow that so easily arises from a laborious pondering over a single hypothesis which, being the only one visible, is a hundredfold overrated. -- Thus he who wishes to offer consolation -- to the unfortunate, ill-doers, hypochondriacs, the dying -- should call to mind the two pacifying formulae of Epicurus, which are capable of being applied to very many questions. Reduced to their simplest form they would perhaps become: firstly, if that is how things are they do not concern us; secondly, things may be thus but they may also be otherwise.  <br />--<cite>Section 7</cite></p>

<p><em>Et in Arcadia ego.</em> -- I looked down, over waves of hills, through fir-trees and spruce trees grave with age, towards a milky green lake: rocky crags of every kind around me, the ground bright with flowers and grasses. A herd of cattle spread itself out before me; solitary cows and groups of cows farther off, in vivid evening light close to the pinewood; others nearer, darker; everything at peace in the contentment of evening. The clock indicated nearly half-past five. The bull of the herd had waded into the white, foaming brook and was slowly following its precipitate course, now resisting it, now yielding: no doubt this was its kind of fierce enjoyment. The herders were two dark-brown creatures Bergamask in origin: the girl clad almost as a boy. To the left, mountain slopes and snowfields beyond broad girdles of woodland; to the right, high above me, two gigantic ice-covered peaks floating in a veil of sunlit vapor -- everything big, still, and bright. The beauty of the whole scene induced in me a sense of awe and of adoration for the moment of its revelation; involuntarily, as if nothing were more natural, I inserted into this pure, clear world of light (in which there was nothing of desire or expectation, no looking before and behind) Hellenic heroes; my feeling must have been like that of Poussin and his pupil: at one and the same time heroic and idyllic. And that is how individual men have actually <em>lived</em>, that is how they have enduringly <em>felt</em> they existed in the world and the world existed in them; and among them was one of the greatest of men, the inventor of the heroic-idyllic mode of philosophizing: Epicurus.  <br />--<cite>Section 295</cite></p>

They answer firstly to <em>elevating</em> thoughts, then to <em>quietening</em>, thirdly to <em>enlightening</em> -- fourthly, however, to thoughts which participate in all three qualities, in which everything earthly comes to transfiguration: it is the kingdom where there reigns the great <em>trinity of joy.</em>  <br />--<cite>Section 332</cite></p>

<p><em>The "after death."</em> -- Christianity discovered the idea of punishment in hell throughout the whole Roman Empire: all the numerous secret cults had brooded on it with especial satisfaction as on the most promising egg of their power. Epicurus believed he could confer no greater benefit on his fellows than by tearing up the roots of <em>this</em> belief: his triumph, which resounds the most beautifully in the mouth of the gloomy and yet enlightened disciple of his teaching, the Roman Lucretius, came too early -- Christianity took the belief in these subterranean terrors, which was already dying out, under its especial protection, and it acted prudently in so doing! How, without this bold recourse to complete heathendom, could it have carried off victory over the popularity of the cults of Mithras and Isis! It thereby brought the timorous over to its side -- the firmest adherents of a new faith! The Jews, as a people fimrly attached to life -- like the Greeks and more than the Greeks -- had paid little attention to these ideas: definitive death as the punishment for the sinner, and never to rise against as the severest threat -- that was sufficient admonition for these strange people, who did not desire to get rid of their bodies but, with their refined Egyptianism, hoped to retain them for all eternity.... Elsewhere, where the drive to life was not as great as it was among Jews and Jewish Christians, and the prospect of immortality did not automatically seem preferable to the prospect of definitive death, that heathen and yet not altogether un-Jewish addition of hell became a welcome instrument in the hands of proslytizers: there arose the novel teaching that the sinner and unredeemed was immortal, the teaching of eternal damnation, and it was mightier than the idea of <em>definitive death</em>, which thereafter faded away. It was only <em>science</em> which reconquered it, as it had to do when it at the same time rejected any other idea of death and of any life beyond it. We have grown poorer by <em>one</em> interest: the "after death" no longer concerns us! -- an unspeakable benefit, which would be felt as such far and wide if it were not so recent. -- And Epicurus triumphs anew!  <br />--<cite>Section 72</cite></p>

<p><em>Chance in marriage.</em> -- If I were a god, and a benevolent god, the <em>marriages</em> of mankind would make me more impatient than anything else. The individual can go far, far in his seventy years, indeed in his thirty years if that is all he has -- it is amazing, even to gods!  But when one then sees how he takes the legacy and inheritance of this struggle and victory, the laurel-wreath of his humanity, and hangs it up at the first decent place where a little woman can get at it and pluck it to pieces: when one sees how well he knows how to gain and how ill to preserve, that he gives no thought to the fact, indeed, that through procreation he could prepare the way for an even more victorious life: then, as aforesaid, one grows impatient and says to oneself: "nothing can come of mankind in the long run, its individuals are squandered, chance in marriage makes a grand rational progress of mankind impossible -- let us cease to be eager spectators and fools of this specatcle without a goal!" -- It was in this mood that the gods of Epicurus once withdrew into their divine happiness and silence: they were tired of mankind and its love affairs.  <br />--<cite>Section 150</cite></p>

<p><em>Epicurus.</em> -- Yes, I am proud of the fact that I experience the character of Epicurus quite differently from perhaps everybody else. Whatever I hear or read of him, I enjoy the happiness of the afternoon of antiquity. I see his eyes gaze upon a wide, white sea, across rocks at the shore that are bathed in sunlight, while large and small animals are playing in this light, as secure and calm as the light and his eyes. Such happiness could be invented only by a man who was suffering continually. It is the happiness of eyes that have seen the sea of existence become calm, and now they can never weary of the surface and of the many hues of this tender, shuddering skin of the sea..

For it is only now that the idea of a personal providence confronts us with the most penetrating force, and the best advocate, the evidence of our eyes, speaks for it -- now that we can see palpably always everything that happens to us turns out for the best. Every day and every hour, life seems to have no other wish than to prove this proposition again and again. Whatever it is, bad weather or good, the loss of a friend, sickness, slander, the failure of some letter to arrive, the spraining of an ankle, a glance into a shop, a counter-argument, the opening of a book, a dream, a fraud -- either immediately or very soon after it proves to be something that "must not be missing": it has a profound significance and use precisely for <em>us</em>. Is there any more dangerous seduction that might tempt one to renounce one's faith in the gods of Epicurus who have no care and are unknown, and to believe instead in some petty deity who is full of care and personally knows every little fair on our head and finds nothing nauseous in the most miserable small service? ...  <br />--<cite>Section 277</cite></p>

<p><em>Stoics and Epicureans.</em> -- The Epicurean selects the situation, the persons, and even the events that suit his extremely irritable, intellectual constitution; he gives up all others, which means almost everything, because they would be too strong and heavy for him to digest. The Stoic, on the other hand, trains himself to swallow stones and worms, slivers of glass and scorpions without nausea; he wants his stomach to become ultimately indifferent to whatever the accidents of existence might pour into it: he reminds one of that Arabian sect of the Assaua whom one encounters in Algiers: like these insensitive people, he, too, enjoys having an audience when he shows off his insensitivity, while the Epicurean would rather dispense with that, having his "garden"! For those with whom fate attempts improvisations -- those who live in violent ages and depend on sudden and mercurial people -- Stoicism may indeed be advisable. But anyone who foresees more or less that fate permits him to spin <em>a long thread</em> does well to make Epicurean arrangements. That is what all those have always done whose work is of the spirit.

<p>... If you who adhere to [the religion of pity] have the same attitude toward yourselves that you have toward your fellow men; if you refuse to let your own suffering lie upon you even for an hour and if you constantly try to prevent and forestall all possible distress way ahead of time; if you experience suffering and displeasure as evil, hateful, worthy of annihilation, and as a defect of existence, then it is clear that besides your religion of pity you also harbor another religion in your heart that is perhaps the mother of the religion of pity: <em>the religion of comfortableness.</em> How little you know of human <em>happiness</em>, you comfortable and benevolent people, for happiness and unhappiness are sisters and even twins that either grow up together or, as in your case, <em>remain small</em> together. But now back to the first question! How is it possible to keep to one's own way? Constantly, some clamor or other calls us aside; rarely does our eye behold anything that does not require us to drop our own preoccupation instantly to help. I know, there are a hundred decent and praiseworthy ways of losing <em>my own way</em>, and they are truly highly "moral"! Indeed, those who now preach the morality of pity even take the view that precisely this and only this is moral -- to lose one's <em>own</em> way in order to come to the assistance of a neighbor.... All such arousing of pity and calling for help is secretly seductive, for our "own way" is too hard and demanding and too remote from the love and gratitude of others, and we do not really mind escaping from it -- and from our very own conscience -- to flee into the conscience of others and into the lovely temple of the "religion of pity".... And while I shall keep silent about some points, I do not want to remain silent about my morality which says to me: Live in seclusion so that you <em>can</em> live for yourself. Live in <em>ignorance</em> about what seems most important to your age. Between yourself and today lay the skin of at least three centuries. And the clamor of today, the noise of wars and revolutions, should be a mere murmur for you. You will also wish to help -- but only those whose distress you <em>understand</em> entirely because they share with you one suffering and one hope -- your friends -- and only in the manner in which you help yourself. I want to make them bolder, more persevering, simpler, gayer, I want to teach them what is understood by so few today, least of all by these preachers of pity: <em>to share not suffering but joy.</em>  <br />--<cite>Section 338</cite></p>

But at last his heart changed -- and one morning he rose with the dawn, stepped before the sun, and spoke to it thus:</p>
<p>"You great star, what would your happiness be if you did not have those for whom you shine? For ten years you have climbed up to my cave: you would have become weary of your light and of the journey had it not been for me and my eagle and my serpent; but we waited for you every morning, took your overflow from you, and blessed your for it. Behold, I am sick of my wisdom, like a bee that has gathered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to receive it; I want to give away and distribute until the wise among men enjoy their folly once again and the poor their riches. For that I must descend to the depths, as you do in the evening when you go behind the sea and still bring light to the underworld, you over-rich star. Like you I must go under, as men put it to whom I wish to descend. Bless me, then, you calm eye that can look without envy even upon an all to great happiness. Bless the cup that wants to overflow in order that the water may flow from it golden and carry the reflection of your rapture everywhere. Behold, this cup wants to become empty again, and Zarathustra wants to become man again." -- Thus Zarathustra began to go under.  <br />--<cite>Section 342 = Zarathustra I.1</cite></p>

<p>How malicious philosophers can be! I know of nothing more venomous than the joke Epicurus permitted himself against Plato and the Platonists; he called them <em>Dionysiokolakes</em>. That means literally -- and this is the foreground meaning -- "flatterers of Dionysius" [the tyrant in Syracuse], in other words, tyrant's baggage and lickspittles; but in addition to this he also wants to say, "they are all <em>actors</em>, there is nothing genuine about them" (for <em>Dionysokolax</em> was a popular name for an actor). And the latter is really the malice that Epicurus aimed at Plato: he was peeved by the grandiose manner, the <em>mise en scene</em> at which Plato and his disciples were so expert -- at which Epicurs was not an expert -- he, that old schoolmaster from Samos, who sat, hidden away, in his little garden at Athens and wrote three hundred books -- who knows? perhaps from rage and ambition against Plato?</p>

<p>The philosopher as we understand him, we free spirits -- as the man of the most comprehensive responsibility who has the conscience for the overall development of man -- this philosopher will make use of religions for his project of cultivation and education, just as he will make use of whatever political and economic states are at hand. The selective and cultivating influence, always destructive as well as creative and form-giving, which can be exerted with the help of religions, is always multiple and different according to the sort of human beings who are placed under its spell and protection. For the strong and independent who are prepared and predestined to command and in whom the reason and art of a governing race become incarnate, religion is one more means for overcoming resistances, for the ability to rule -- as a bond that unites rulers and subjects, and betrays and delivers the consciences of the latter (that which is most concealed and intimate and would like to elude obedience) to the fomer. And if a few individuals of such noble descent are induced through lofty spirituality to prefer a more withdrawn and contemplative life and reserve for themselves only the most subtle type of rule (over selected disciples or brothers in some order), then religion can even be used as a means for obtaining peace from the noise and exertion of <em>cruder</em> forms of government, and purity from the <em>necessary</em> dirt of all politics....</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>What is romanticism?</em> Every art, every philosophy may be viewed as a remedy and an aid in the service of growing and struggling life; they always presuppose suffering and sufferers. But there are two kinds of sufferers: first, those who suffer from the <em>over-fulness of life</em> -- they want a Dionysian art and likewise a tragic view of life, a tragic insight -- and then those who suffer from the <em>impoverishment of life</em> and who seek rest, stillness, calm seas, redemption from themselves through art and knowledge, or intoxication, convulsions, anesthesia, and madness. All romanticism in art and insight corresponds to the dual needs of the latter type, and that included (and includes) Schopenhauer as well as Richard Wagner, to name the two most famous and pronounced romantics whom I <em>misunderstood</em> at that time -- <em>not</em>, incidentally, to their disadvantage, as one need not hesitate in all fairness to admit. He that is richest in the fullness of life, the Dionysian god and man, cannot only afford the sight of the terrible and questionable but even the terrible deed and any luxury of destruction, decomposition, and negation. In his case, what is evil, absurb, and ugly seems, as it were, permissable, owing to the excess of procreating, fertilizing energies that can still turn any desert into lush farmland. Conversely, those who suffer most and are poorest in life would need above all mildness, peacefulness, and goodness in thought as well as deed -- if possible, also a god who would be truly a god for the sick, a healer and savior; also logic, the conceptual understandability of existence -- for logic calms and gives confidence -- in short, a certain warm narrowness that keeps away fear and encloses one in optimistic horizons.</p>
<p>Thus I gradually learned to understand Epicurus, the opposite of a Dionysian pessimist; also the "Christian" who is actually only a kind of Epicurean -- both are essentially romantics -- and my eye grew ever sharper for that most difficult and captious form of <em>backward inference</em> in which the most mistakes are made: the backward inference from the work to the maker, from the deed to the doer, from the ideal to those who <em>need it</em>, from every way of thinking and valuing to the commanding need behind it.</p>
<p>Regarding all aesthetic values I now avail myself of this main distinction: I ask in every instance, "is it hunger or super-adundance that has here become creative?" At first glance, another distinction may seem preferable -- it is far more obvious -- namely the question whether the desire to fix, to immortalize, the desire for <em>being</em> prompted creation, or the desire for destruction, for change, for future, for <em>becoming</em>. But both of these kinds of desire are seen to be ambiguous when one considers them more closely; they can be interpreted in accordance with the first scheme (which is, as it seems to me, preferable). The desire for <em>destruction</em>, change, becoming, can be an expression of an overflowing energy that is pregnant with the future (my term for this is, as known, "Dionysian"); but it can also be the hatred of the ill-constituted, disinherited, and underprivileged, who destroy, <em>must</em> destroy, because what exists, indeed all existence, all being, outrages and provokes them. To understand this feeling, consider our anarchists closely.</p>
<p>The will to <em>immortalize</em> also requires a dual interpretation. It can be prompted, first, by gratitude and love; art with this origin will always be an art of apotheosis, perhaps dithyrambic like Rubens, or blissfully mocking like Hafiz, or bright and gracious like Goethe, spreading a Homeric light and glory over all things. But it can also be the tyrannic will of one who suffers deeply, who struggles, is tormented, and would like to turn what is most personal, singular, and narrow, the real idiosyncrasy of his suffering, into a binding law and compulsion -- one who, as it were, revenges himself on all things by forcing his own image, the image of his torture, on them, branding them with it. This last version is <em>romantic pessimism</em> in its most expressive form, whether it be Schopenhauer's philosophy of will or Wagner's music -- romantic pessimism, the last <em>great</em> event in the fate of our culture.</p>
<p>(That there still <em>could</em> be an altogether different kind of pessimism, a classical type -- this premonition and vision belongs to me as inseperable from me, as my <em>proprium</em> and <em>ipsissimum</em>; only the word "classical" offends my ears, it is far too trite and has become round and indistinct. I call this pessimism of the future -- for it comes! I see it coming! -- <em>Dionysian</em> pessimism.) <br />--<cite>Section 370</cite></p>

<p><em>Why we look like Epicureans.</em> -- We are cautious, we modern men, about ultimate convictions. Our mistrust lies in wait for the enchantments and deceptions of the conscience that are involved in every strong faith, every unconditional Yes and No. How is this to be explained? Perhaps what is to be found here is largely the care of the "burned child", of the disappointed idealist; but there is also another, superior component: the jubilant curiosity of one who formerly stood in his corner and was driven to despair by his corner, and now delights and luxuriates in the opposite of a corner, in the boundless, in what is "free as such". Thus an almost Epicurean bent for knowledge develops that will not easily let go of the questionable character of things; also an aversion to big moral words and gestures; a taste that rejects all crude, four-square opposites and is proudly conscious of its practice in having reservations. For this constitutes our pride, this slight tightening of the reins as our urge for certainty races ahead, this self-control of the rider during his wildest rides; for we still ride mad and fiery horses, and when we hesitate it is least of all danger that makes us hesitate.  <br />--<cite>Section 375</cite></p>

<h5>The Genealogy of Morals</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>Of few things does Schopenhauer speak with greater assuance than he does of the effect of aesthetic contemplation: he says of it that it counteracts <em>sexual</em> "interestedness," like lupulin and camphor; he never wearied of glorifying <em>this</em> liberation from the "will" as the great merit and utility of the aesthetic condition. Indeed, one might be tempted to ask whether his basic conception of "will and representation," the thought that redemption from the "will" could be attained only through "representation," did not originate as a generalization from this sexual experience.... Listen, for instance, to one of the most explicit of the countless passages he has writen in praise of the aesthetic condition (<cite>World as Will and Representation</cite>, Book III, Section 38); listen to the tone, the suffering, the happiness, the gratitude expressed in such words:</p>
<p>"This is the painless condition that Epicurus praised as the highest good and the condition of the gods; for a moment we are delivered from the vile urgency of the will; we celebrate the Sabbath of the penal servitude of volition; the wheel of Ixion stands still!"  <br />--<cite>Third Essay, Section 6</cite></p>

<p>Let us therefore honor "redemption" as it appears in the great religions. But it is not easy for us to take seriously the high valuation placed on <em>deep sleep</em> by these people, so weary of life that they are too weary even to dream -- deep sleep, that is, as an entry into Brahma, as an <em>achieved unio mystica</em> with God....</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we must bear in mind here, as in the case of "redemption," that, although it is arrayed in Oriental exaggeration, what is expressed here is merely the same appraisal as that of the clear, cool, Hellenically cool, but suffering Epicurus: the hypnotic sense of nothingness, the repose of deepest sleep, in short <em>absence of suffering</em> -- sufferers and those profoundly depressed will count this as the supreme good, as the value of values; they are <em>bound</em> to accord it a positive value, to experience it as <em>the</em> positive as such.

<blockquote>
<p>In many cases, to be sure, "peace of soul" is merely a misunderstanding -- something else, which lacks only a more honest name. Without further ado or prejudice, a few examples. "Peace of soul" can be, for one, the gentle radiation of a rich animality into the moral (or religious) sphere. Or the beginning of weariness, the first shadow of evening, of any kind of evening. Or a sign that the air is humid, that south winds are approaching. Or unrecognized gratitude for a good digestion (sometimes called "love of man"). Or the attainment of calm by a convalescent who feels a new relish in all things and waits. Or the state which follows a thorough satisfaction of our dominant passion, the well-being of a rare repletion. Or the senile weakness of our will, our cravings, our vices. Or laziness, persuaded by vanity to give itself moral airs. Or the emergence of certainty, even a dreadful certainty, after long tension and torture by uncertainty. Or the expression of maturity and mastery in the midst of doing, creating, working, and willing -- calm breathing, <em>attained</em> "freedom of the will." <em>Twilight of the Idols</em> -- who knows?

<h5>The Antichrist</h5>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The instinctive hatred of reality:</em> a consequence of an extreme capacity for suffering and excitement which no longer wants any contact at all because it feels every contact too deeply.</p>
<p><em>The instinctive exclusion of any antipathy, any hostility, any boundaries or divisions in man's feelings:</em> the consequence of an extreme capacity for suffering and excitement which experiences any resistence, even any compulsion to resist, as unendurable <em>displeasure</em> (that is, as <em>harmful,</em>, as something against which the instinct of self-preservation <em>warns</em> us); and finds blessedness (pleasure) only in no longer offering any resistance to anybody, neither to evil nor to him who is evil -- love as the only, as the <em>last</em> possible, way of life.</p>
<p>These are the two <em>physiological realities</em> on which, out of which, the doctrine of redemption grew. I call this a sublime further development of hedonism on a thoroughly morbid basis. Most closely related to it, although with a generous admixture of Greek vitality and nervous energy, is Epicureanism, the pagan doctrine of redemption. Epicurus -- a <em>typical decadent</em> -- first recognized as such by me. The fear of pain, even of infinitely minute pain -- that can end in no other way than in a <em>religion of love.</em>  <br />--<cite>Section 30</cite></p>

<p>Let us take the philosophers of Greece, e.g., Plato. He severed the instincts from the <em>polis</em>, from contest, from military efficiency, from art and beauty, from the mysteries, from belief in tradition and ancestors -- he was the seducer of the nobility: he was himself seduced by the <em>roturier</em> Socrates -- he negated all the presuppositions of the "noble Greek" of the old stamp, made dialectic an everyday practice, conspired with tyrants, pursued politics of the future and provided the example of the most complete severance of the instincts from the past. He is profound, passionate in everything <em>anti</em>-Hellenic --</p>
<p>These great philosophers represent one after the other the typical forms of decadence: the moral-religious idiosyncrasy, anarchism, nihilism (<em>adiaphora</em>), cynicism, obduracy, hedonism, reaction.</p>
<p>The question of "happiness", of "virtue", of "salvation of the soul" is the expression of physiological contradictoriness in these types of decline: their instincts lack a center of gravity, a purpose.  <br />--<cite>Section 435</cite>, March-June 1888</p>

<p>... Pyrrho, like Epicurus, two forms of Greek decadence: related, in hatred for dialectics and for all theatrical virtues -- these two together were in those days called philosophy --; deliberately holding in low esteem that which they loved; choosing common, even despised names for it; representing a state in which one is neither sick nor well, neither alive nor dead --</p>
<p>Epicurus more naive, idyllic, grateful; Pyrrho more traveled, experienced, nihilistic -- His life was a protest against the great doctrine of identity (happiness = virtue = knowledge). One cannot promote the right way of life through science: wisdom does not make "wise" -- The right way of life does not want happiness, turns away from happiness.  <br />--<cite>Section 437</cite>, March-June 1888</p>

<p>This is extraordinary. We find from the beginning of Greek philosophy onwards a struggle against science with the means of an epistemology or skepticism: and with what object? Always for the good of <em>morality</em> --</p>
<p>(Hatred for physicists and physicians.) Socrates, Aristippus, the Megarian school, the Cynics, Epicurus, Pyrrho -- a general assult on knowledge for the good of morality ....  <br />--<cite>Section 442</cite>, March-June 1888</p>

<p>Man does <me>not</em> seek pleasure and avoid displeasure: one will realize which famous prejudice I am contradicting. Pleasure and displeasure are mere consequences, mere epiphenomena -- what man wants, what every smallest part of a living organism wants, is an increase of power. Pleasure or displeasure follow from the striving after that; driven by that will it seeks resistance, it needs something that opposes it -- Displeasure, as an obstacle to its will to power, is therefore a normal fact, the normal ingredient of every organic event; man does not avoid it, he is rather in continual need of it; every victory, every feeling of pleasure, every event, presupposes a resistance overcome....  <br />--<cite>Section 702</cite>, March-June 1888</p>

<p>... The great confusion on the part of psychologists consisted in not distinguishing between these two kinds of pleasure -- that of falling asleep and that of victory. The exhausted want rest, relaxation, peace, calm -- the happiness of the nihilistic religions and philosophies; the rich and living want victory, opponents overcome, the overflow of the feeling of power across wider dimensions than hitherto. All healthy functions of the organism have this need -- and the whole organism is such a complex of systems struggling for an increase of the feeling of power.  <br />--<cite>Section 703</cite>, March-June 1888</p>

<p><em>What is noble?</em> -- That one constantly has to play a part. That one seeks situations in which one has constant need of poses. That one leaves happiness to the great majority: happiness as peace of soul, virtue, comfort, Anglo-angelic shopkeeperdom a la Spencer. That one instinctively seeks heavy responsibilities. That one knows how to make enemies everywhere, if the worst comes to the worst even of oneself. That one constantly contradicts the great majority not through words but through deeds.  <br />--<cite>Section 944</cite>, Jan. - Fall 1888</p>

<h1>Seasons of Thoreau</h1>
<h2>Reflections on Life and Nature</h2>

<h2>Spring</h2>

<p>Soon after John's death I listened to a music-box, and if, at any time, that event had seemed inconsistent with the beauty and harmony of the universe, it was then gently constrained into the placid course of nature by those steady notes, in mild and unoffended tone echoing far and wide under the heavens. But I find these things more strange than sad to me. What right have I to grieve, who have not ceased to wonder? We feel at first as if some opportunities of kindness and sympathy were lost, but learn afterward that any <em>pure grief</em> is ample recompense for all. That is, if we are faithful; for a great grief is but sympathy with the soul that disposes events, and is as natural as the resin on Arabian trees. Only Nature has a right to grieve perpetually, for she only is innocent. Soon the ice will melt, and the blackbirds sing along the river which he frequented, as pleasantly as ever. The same everlasting serenity will appear in this face of God, and we will not be sorrowful if he is not.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Lucy Brown, March 2, 1842</p>

<p>This has indeed been a grand winter for me, and for all of us. I am not considering how much I have enjoyed it. What matters it how happy or unhappy we have been, if we have minded our business and advanced our affairs?</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Daniel Ricketson, March 5, 1856</p>

<p>I see by the newspapers that the season for making sugar is at hand. Now is the time, whether you be rock, or white maple, or hickory. I trust that you have prepared a store of sap-tubs and sumach spouts, and invested largely in kettles. Early the first frosty morning, tap your maples,&mdash;the sap will not run in summer, you know. It matters not how little juice you get, if you get all you can, and boil it down. I made just one crystal of sugar once, one twentieth of an inch cube, out of a pumpkin, and it sufficed. Though the yield be no greater than that, this is not less the season for it, and it will be not the less sweet, nay, it will be infinitely the sweeter.</p>
<p>Shall, then, the maple yield sugar, and not man?  Shall the farmer be thus active, and surely have so much sugar to show for it, before this very March is gone,&mdash;while I read the newspaper? While he works in his sugar-camp let me work in mine,&mdash;for sweetness is in me, and to sugar it shall come,&mdash;it shall not all go to leaves and wood. Am I not a <em>sugar maple</em> man, then? Boil down the sweet sap which the spring causes to flow within you. Stop not at syrup,&mdash;go on to sugar, though you present the world with but a single crystal,&mdash;a crystal not made from trees in your yard, but from the new life that stirs in your pores.  Cheerfully skim your kettle, and watch it set and crystallize, making a holiday of it if you will. Heaven will be propitious to you as to him.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Harrison Blake, March 13, 1856</p>

<p>I <em>suppose</em> that I have not many months to live; but, of course, I know nothing about it. I may add that I am enjoying existence as much as ever, and regret nothing.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Myron B. Benton, March 21, 1862</p>

<p>I do believe in simplicity. It is astonishing as well as sad, how many trivial affairs even the wisest man thinks he must attend to in a day; how singular an affair he thinks he must omit. When the mathematician would solve a difficult problem, he first frees the equation of all incumbrances, and reduces it to its simplest terms. So simplify the problem of life, distinguish the necessary and the real. Probe the earth to see where your main roots run. I would stand upon facts.  Why not see,&mdash;use our eyes? Do men know nothing?  I know many men who, in common things, are not to be deceived; who trust no moonshine; who count their money correctly, and know how to invest it; who are said to be prudent and knowing, who yet will stand at a desk the greater part of their lives, as cashiers in banks, and glimmer and rust and finally go out there.  If they <em>know</em> anything, what under the sun do they do that for? Do they know what <em>bread</em> is? or what it is for? Do they know what life is? If they <em>knew</em> something, the places which know them now would know them no more forever.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Harrison Blake, March 27, 1848</p>

<p>What I was learning in college was chiefly, I think, to express myself, and I see now, that as the old orator prescribed, 1st, action; 2d, action; 3d, action; my teachers should have prescribed to me, 1st, sincerity; 2d, sincerity; 3d, sincerity. The old mythology is incomplete without a god or goddess of sincerity, on whose altars we might offer up all the products of our farms, our workshops, and our studies. It should be our Lar when we sit on the hearth, and our Tutelar Genius when we walk abroad. This is the only panacea. I mean sincerity in our dealings with ourselves mainly; any other is comparatively easy. But I must stop before I get to 17thly. I believe I have but one text and one sermon.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Richard F. Fuller, April 2, 1843</p>

<p>Will you live? or will you be embalmed? Will you live, though it be astride of a sunbeam; or will you repose safely in the catacombs for a thousand years?  In the former case, the worst accident that can happen is that you may break your neck. Will you break your heart, your soul, to save your neck? Necks and pipe-stems are fated to be broken. Men make a great ado about the folly of demanding too much of life (or of eternity?), and of endeavoring to live according to that demand. It is much ado about nothing. No harm ever came from that quarter. I am not afraid that I shall exaggerate the value and significance of life, but that I shall not be up to the occasion which it is. I shall be sorry to remember that I was there, but noticed nothing remarkable,&mdash;not so much as a prince in disguise; lived in the golden age a hired man; visited Olympus even, but fell asleep after dinner, and did not hear the conversation of the gods.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Harrison Blake, April 3, 1850</p>

<p>I do not so much regret the present condition of things in this country (provided I regret it at all), as I do that I ever heard of it. I know one or two, who have this year, for the first time, read a President's Message; but they do not see that this implies a <em>fall</em> in themselves, rather than a <em>rise</em> in the President. Blessed were the days before you read a President's Message.  Blessed are the young, for they do not read the President's Message. Blessed are they who never read a newspaper, for they shall see Nature, and, through her, God.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Parker Pillsbury, April 10, 1861</p>

<p>How shall we account for our pursuits, if they are original? We get the language with which to describe our various lives out of a common mint. If others have their losses which they are busy repairing, so have I mine, and their hound and horse may <em>perhaps</em> be the symbols of some of them.  But also I have lost, or am in danger of losing, a far finer and more ethereal treasure which commonly no loss, of which they are conscious, will symbolize. </p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to B.B Wiley, April 26, 1857</p>

<p>How shall we earn our bread is a grave question; yet it is a sweet and inviting question. Let us not shirk it, as is usually done. It is the most important and practical question which is put to man. Let us not answer it hastily. Let us not be content to get our bread in some gross, careless, and hasty manner. Some men go a-hunting, some a-fishing, some a-gaming, some to war; but none have so pleasant a time as they who in earnest seek to earn their bread. It is true actually as it is true really; it is true materially as it is true spiritually, that they who seek honestly and sincerely, with all their hearts and lives and strength, to earn their bread, do earn it, and it is sure to be very sweet to them. A very little bread,&mdash;a very few crumbs are enough, if it be of the right quality, for it is infinitely nutritious. Let each man, then, earn at least a crumb of bread for his body before he dies, and know the taste of it,&mdash;that it is identical with the bread of life, and that they both go down at one swallow.</p>
<p>Our bread need not ever be sour or hard to digest.  What Nature is to the mind she is also to the body.  As she feeds my imagination, she will feed my body; for what she says she means, and is ready to do. She is not simply beautiful to the poet's eye. Not only the rainbow and sunset are beautiful, but to be fed and clothed, sheltered and warmed aright, are equally beautiful and inspiring.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Harrison Blake, May 2, 1848</p>

<p>As for the dispute about solitude and society, any comparison is impertinent. It is an idling down on the plane at the base of a mountain, instead of climbing steadily to its top. Of course you will be glad of all the society you can get to go up with. Will you go to glory with me? is the burden of the song. I love society so much that I swallowed it all at a gulp,&mdash;that is, all that came in my way. It is not that we love to be alone, but that we love to soar, and when we do soar, the company grows thinner and thinner till there is none at all. It is either the <em>Tribune</em> on the plain, a sermon on the mount, or a very private ecstasy still higher up. We are not the less to aim at the summits, though the multitude does not ascend them. Use all the society that will abet you. But perhaps I do not enter into the spirit of your talk.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Harrison Blake, May 21, 1856</p>

<p>Some absorbing employment on your higher ground,&mdash;your upland farm,&mdash;whither no cart-path leads, but where you mount alone with your hoe,&mdash;where the life everlasting grows; there you raise a crop which needs not to be brought down into the valley to a market; which you barter for heavenly products.</p>
<p>Do you separate distinctly enough the support of your body from that of your essence? By how distinct a course commonly are these two ends attained! Not that they should not be attained by one and the same means,&mdash;that, indeed, is the rarest success,&mdash;but there is no half and half about it.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Harrison Blake, May 28, 1850</p>

<h2>Summer</h2>

<p>Staying at home is the heavenly way.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Ralph Waldo Emerson, July 8, 1843</p>

<p>All the world complain nowadays of a press of trivial duties and engagements, which prevents their employing themselves on some higher ground they know of; but, undoubtedly, if they were made of the right stuff to work on that higher ground, provided they were released from all those engagements, they would now at once fulfill the superior engagement, and neglect all the rest, as naturally as they breathe. They would never be caught saying that they had no time for this, when the dullest man knows that this is all that he has time for. No man who acts from a sense of duty ever puts the lesser duty above the greater. No man has the desire and the ability to work on high things, but he has also the ability to build himself a high staging.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Harrison Blake, July 21, 1852</p>

<p>I have but just returned from a pedestrian excursion somewhat similar to that you propose, <em>parvis componere magna</em>, to the Catskill Mountains, over the principal mountains of this State, subsisting mainly on bread and berries, and slumbering on the mountain-tops. As usually happens, I now feel a slight sense of dissipation. Still, I am strongly tempted by your proposal, and experience a decided schism between my outward and inward tendencies. Your method of traveling, especially,&mdash;to live along the road, citizens of the world, without haste or petty plans,&mdash;I have often proposed this to my dreams, and still do. But the fact is, I cannot so decidedly postpone exploring the <em>Farther Indies</em>, which are to be reached, you know, by other routes and other methods of travel. I mean that I constantly return from every external enterprise with disgust, to fresh faith in a kind of Brahminical, Artesian, Inner Temple life. All my experience, as yours probably, proves only this reality.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Isaac Hecker, August 14, 1844</p>

<p>With regard to essentials, I have never had occasion to change my mind. The aspect of the world varies from year to year, as the landscape is differently clothed, but I find that the truth is still true, and I never regret any emphasis which it may have inspired. Ktaadn is there still, but much more surely my old conviction is there, resting with more than mountain breadth and weight on the world, the source still of fertilizing streams, and affording glorious views from its summit, if I can get up to it again.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Harrison Blake, August 18, 1857</p>

<p>Whether a man spends his day in an ecstasy or despondency, he must do some work to show for it, even as there are flesh and bones to show for him. We are superior to the joy we experience.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Harrison Blake, August 19, 1853</p>

<p>We love to see any redness in the vegetation of the temperate zone. It is the color of colors. This plant speaks to our blood. It asks a bright sun on it to make it show to best advantage, and it must be seen at this season of the year. On warm hillsides its stems are ripe by the twenty-third of August. At that date I walked through a beautiful grove of them, six or seven feet high, on the side of one of our cliffs, where they ripen early. Quite to the ground they were a deep, brilliant purple, with a bloom contrasting with the still clear green leaves. It appears a rare triumph of Nature to have produced and perfected such a plant, as if this were enough for a summer. What a perfect maturity it arrives at! It is the emblem of a successful life concluded by a death not premature, which is an ornament to Nature.</p>
<p>&mdash;Autumnal Tints</p>

<h2>Fall</h2>

<p>I am as unfit for any practical purpose &mdash; I mean for the furtherance of the world's ends &mdash; as gossamer for ship-timber; and I, who am going to be a pencil-maker to-morrow, can sympathize with God Apollo, who served King Admetus for a while on earth. But I believe he found it for his advantage at last,&mdash;as I am sure I shall, though I shall hold the nobler part at least out of the service.</p>
<p>Don't attach any undue seriousness to this threnody, for I love my fate to the very core and rind, and could swallow it without paring it, I think.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Lucy Brown, September 8, 1841</p>

<p>Why will not I, having common sense, write in plain English always; <em>teach</em> men in detail how to live a simpler life, etc.; not go off into &mdash;&mdash;? But I say that I have no scheme about it,&mdash;no designs on men at all; and, if I had, my mode would be to tempt them with the fruit, and not with the manure. To what end do I lead a simple life at all, pray? That I may teach others to simplify their lives?&mdash;and so all our lives be <em>simplified</em> merely, like an algebraic formula?  Or not, rather, that I may make use of the ground I have cleared, to live more worthily and profitably? I would fain lay the most stress forever on that which is the most important,&mdash;imports the most to me,&mdash;though it were only (what it is likely to be) a vibration in the air. As a preacher, I should be prompted to tell men, not so much how to get their wheat bread cheaper, as of the bread of life compared with which <em>that</em> is bran. Let a man only taste these loaves, and he becomes a skillful economist at once. He'll not waste much time in earning those. Don't spend your time in drilling soldiers, who may turn out hirelings after all, but give to undrilled peasantry a <em>country</em> to fight for.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Harrison Blake, September 26, 1855</p>

<p>Most appear to confound changed leaves with withered ones, as if they were to confound ripe apples with rotten ones. I think that the change to some higher color in a leaf is an evidence that it has arrived at a late and perfect maturity, answering to the maturity of fruits. It is generally the lowest and oldest leaves which change first. But as the perfect-winged and usually bright-colored insect is short-lived, so the leaves ripen but to fall.</p>
<p>Generally, every fruit, on ripening, and just before it falls, when it commences a more independent and individual existence, requiring less nourishment from any source, and that not so much from the earth through its stem as from the sun and air, acquires a bright tint. So do leaves.</p>
<p>Flowers are but colored leaves, fruits but ripe ones. The edible part of most fruits is, as the physiologist says, "the parenchyma or fleshy tissue of the leaf," of which they are formed.</p>
<p>Our appetites have commonly confined our views of ripeness and its phenomena, color, mellowness, and perfectness, to the fruits which we eat, and we are wont to forget that an immense harvest which we do not eat, hardly use at all, is annually ripened by Nature. At our annual cattle-shows and horticultural exhibitions, we make, as we think, a great show of fair fruits, destined, however, to a rather ignoble end, fruits not valued for their beauty chiefly. But round about and within our towns there is annually another show of fruits, on an infinitely grander scale, fruits which address our taste for beauty alone.</p>
<p>October is the month for painted leaves. Their rich glow now flashes round the world. As fruits and leaves and the day itself acquire a bright tint just before they fall, so the year near its setting. October is its sunset sky; November the later twilight.</p>
<p>&mdash;Autumnal Tints</p>

<p>Now too, the first of October, or later, the elms are at the height of their autumnal beauty,—great brownish-yellow masses, warm from their September oven, hanging over the highway. Their leaves are perfectly ripe. I wonder if there is any answering ripeness in the lives of the men who live beneath them.</p>
<p>&mdash;Autumnal Tints</p>

<p>It is pleasant to walk over the beds of these fresh, crisp, and rustling leaves. How beautifully they go to their graves! how gently lay themselves down and turn to mould!—painted of a thousand hues, and fit to make the beds of us living. So they troop to their last resting-place, light and frisky. They put on no weeds, but merrily they go scampering over the earth, selecting the spot, choosing a lot, ordering no iron fence, whispering all through the woods about it,—some choosing the spot where the bodies of men are mouldering beneath, and meeting them half-way. How many flutterings before they rest quietly in their graves! They that soared so loftily, how contentedly they return to dust again, and are laid low, resigned to lie and decay at the foot of the tree, and afford nourishment to new generations of their kind, as well as to flutter on high! They teach us how to die. One wonders if the time will ever come when men, with their boasted faith in immortality, will lie down as gracefully and as ripe,—with such an Indian-summer serenity will shed their bodies, as they do their hair and nails.</p>
<p>&mdash;Autumnal Tints</p>

<p>To tell the truth, I am planning to get seriously to work after these long months of inefficiency and idleness.  I do not know whether you are haunted by any such demon which puts you on the alert to pluck the fruit of each day as it passes, and store it safely in your bin.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Daniel Ricketson, October 16, 1855</p>

<h2>Winter</h2>

<p>I think you may have a grand time this winter pursuing some study,&mdash;keeping a journal, or the like,&mdash;while the snow lies deep without. Winter is the time for study, you know, and the colder it is the more studious we are.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Sophia Thoreau, October 24, 1847</p>

<p>How wholesome winter is, seen far or near; how good, above all mere sentimental, warm-blooded, short-lived, soft-hearted, <em>moral</em> goodness, commonly so called. Give me the goodness which has forgotten its own deeds,&mdash;which God has seen to be good, and let be. None of your <em>just made perfect</em>,&mdash;pickled eels! All that will save them will be their picturesqueness, as with blasted trees. Whatever is, and is not ashamed to be, is good.  I value no moral goodness or greatness unless it is good or great, even as that snowy peak is. Pray, how could thirty feet of bowels improve it? Nature is goodness crystallized. You looked into the land of promise.  Whatever beauty we behold, the more it is distant, serene, and cold, the purer and more durable it is. It is better to warm ourselves with ice than with fire.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Daniel Ricketson, November 4, 1860</p>

<p>The wonderful purity of nature at this season is a most pleasing fact. Every decayed stump and moss-grown stone and rail, and the dead leaves of autumn, are concealed by a clean napkin of snow. In the bare fields and tinkling woods, see what virtue survives. In the coldest and bleakest places, the warmest charities still maintain a foothold. A cold and searching wind drives away all contagion, and nothing can withstand it but what has a virtue in it, and accordingly, whatever we meet with in cold and bleak places, as the tops of mountains, we respect for a sort of sturdy innocence, a Puritan toughness. All things beside seem to be called in for shelter, and what stays out must be part of the original frame of the universe, and of such valor as God himself. It is invigorating to breathe the cleansed air. Its greater fineness and purity are visible to the eye, and we would fain stay out long and late, that the gales may sigh through us, too, as through the leafless trees, and fit us for the winter,—as if we hoped so to borrow some pure and steadfast virtue, which will stead us in all seasons.</p>
<p>&mdash; A Winter's Walk</p>

<p>I am grateful for what I am and have. My thanksgiving is perpetual. It is surprising how contented one can be with nothing definite,&mdash;only a sense of existence.  Well, anything for variety. I am ready to try this for the next ten thousand years, and exhaust it. How sweet to think of! my extremities well charred, and my intellectual part too, so that there is no danger of worm or rot for a long while. My breath is sweet to me. O how I laugh when I think of my vague, indefinite riches. No run on my bank can drain it, for my wealth is not possession but enjoyment.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Harrison Blake, December 6, 1856</p>

<p>I cannot say that Swedenborg has been directly and practically valuable to me, for I have not been a reader of him, except to a slight extent; but I have the highest regard for him, and trust that I shall read his works in some world or other. He had a wonderful knowledge of our interior and spiritual life, though his illuminations are occasionally blurred by trivialities. He comes nearer to answering, or attempting to answer, literally, your questions concerning man's origin, purpose, and destiny, than any of the worthies I have referred to. But I think that that is not <em>altogether</em> a recommendation; since such an answer to these questions cannot be discovered any more than perpetual motion, for which no reward is now offered. The noblest man it is, methinks, that knows, and by his life suggests, the most about these things. Crack away at these nuts, however, as long as you can,&mdash;the very exercise will ennoble you, and you may get something better than the answer you expect.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to B.B. Wiley, December 12, 1856</p>

<p>We must heap up a great pile of doing, for a small diameter of being. Is it not imperative on us that we <em>do</em> something, if we only work in a treadmill? And, indeed, some sort of revolving is necessary to produce a centre and nucleus of being. What exercise is to the body, employment is to the mind and morals. Consider what an amount of drudgery must be performed,&mdash;how much humdrum and prosaic labor goes to any work of the least value.  There are so many layers of mere white lime in every shell to that thin inner one so beautifully tinted. Let not the shellfish think to build his house of that alone; and pray, what are its tints to him? Is it not his smooth, close-fitting shirt merely, whose tints <em>are not</em> to him, being in the dark, but only when he is gone or dead, and his shell is heaved up to light, a wreck upon the beach, do they appear. With him, too, it is a Song of the Shirt, "Work,&mdash;work,&mdash;work!" And the work is not merely a police in the gross sense, but in the higher sense a discipline. If it is surely the means to the highest end we know, can any work be humble or disgusting? Will it not rather be elevating as a ladder, the means by which we are translated?</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Harrison Blake, December 19, 1854</p>

<p>As the least drop of wine tinges the whole goblet, so the least particle of truth colors our whole life. It is never isolated, or simply added as treasure to our stock. When any real progress is made, we unlearn and learn anew what we thought we knew before.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, December 31, 1837</p>

<p>What mountain are you camping on nowadays?  Though I had a good time at the mountains, I confess that the journey did not bear any fruit that I know of.  I did not expect it would. The mode of it was not simple and adventurous enough. You must first have made an infinite demand, and not unreasonably, but after a corresponding outlay, have an all-absorbing purpose, and at the same time that your feet bear you hither and thither, travel much more in imagination.</p>
<p>To let the mountains slide,&mdash;live at home like a traveler. It should not be in vain that these things are shown us from day to day. Is not each withered leaf that I see in my walks something which I have traveled to find?&mdash;traveled, who can tell how far? What a fool he must be who thinks that his El Dorado is anywhere but where he lives!</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Harrison Blake, January 1, 1859</p>

<p>I should consider it a greater success to interest one wise and earnest soul, than a million unwise and frivolous.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Calvin H. Greene, February 10, 1856</p>

<p>The richest gifts we can bestow are the least marketable.  We hate the kindness which we understand. A noble person confers no such gift as his whole confidence: none so exalts the giver and the receiver; it produces the truest gratitude. Perhaps it is only essential to friendship that some vital trust should have been reposed by the one in the other. I feel addressed and probed even to the remote parts of my being when one nobly shows, even in trivial things, an implicit faith in me. When such divine commodities are so near and cheap, how strange that it should have to be each day's discovery! A threat or a curse may be forgotten, but this mild trust translates me. I am no more of this earth; it acts dynamically; it changes my very substance. I cannot do what before I did. I cannot be what before I was. Other chains may be broken, but in the darkest night, in the remotest place, I trail this thread. Then things cannot <em>happen</em>. What if God were to confide in us for a moment! Should we not then be gods?</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Ralph Waldo Emerson, February 12 1843</p>

<p>The problem of life becomes, one cannot say by how many degrees, more complicated as our material wealth is increased,&mdash;whether that needle they tell of was a gateway or not,&mdash;since the problem is not merely nor mainly to get life for our bodies, but by this or a similar discipline to get life for our souls; by cultivating the lowland farm on right principles, that is, with this view, to turn it into an upland farm. You have so many more talents to account for. If I accomplish as much more in spiritual work as I am richer in worldly goods, then I am just as worthy, or worth just as much, as I was before, and no more. I see that, in my own case, money <em>might</em> be of great service to me, but probably it would not be; for the difficulty now is, that I do not improve my opportunities, and therefore I am not prepared to have my opportunities increased. Now, I warn you, if it be as you say, you have got to put on the pack of an upland farmer in good earnest the coming spring, the lowland farm being cared for; ay, you must be selecting your seeds forthwith, and doing what winter work you can; and, while others are raising potatoes and Baldwin apples for you, you must be raising apples of the Hesperides for them. (Only hear how he preaches!) No man can suspect that he is the proprietor of an upland farm,&mdash;upland in the sense that it will produce nobler crops, and better repay cultivation in the long run,&mdash;but he will be perfectly sure that he ought to cultivate it.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Harrison Blake, February 27, 1853</p>

<h3>1. Farm (February 7)</h3>

<p>I rose above my common hours to go in search of Thoreau's farm: not the lowland farm out at Walden Pond where he made the soil say beans, but the upland farm of his inner life where he made his soul say being.</p>
<p>Thoreau hid the approach to his upland farm behind a thicket of symbols and images. Thus we must laboriously seek the meaning of each fragrant word and significant line in his voluminous writings, conjecturing a larger sense than the common uses to which he is so often put: the hermit, the gadfly, the political activist, the environmentalist, the advocate for voluntary simplicity. Although he was all these things at times, they do not explain him.</p>
<p>The essence of his quest was to pursue some absorbing employment on the higher ground of his soul, to raise a crop that he could barter for heavenly products, to lay a foundation under the castle he had built in the air, to create a moral and intellectual domain over which he had firm possession.</p>
<p>As in the Bhagavat-Gita, the classic of Indian philosophy that he so treasured, in Thoreau's mind the great field to be cultivated is the self, and the greatest achievement is liberation through self-possession, self-control, and self-mastery. Because the English word "farm" refers to that over which one has firm possession and because the Sanskrit word "dharma" refers to that which is firmly established &mdash; that is, the right way of living &mdash; it turns out that the upland farmer is a cultivator of dharma!</p>
<p>Even though the upland farm is hard to find, Thoreau provided some clues regarding its location.</p>
<p>In Walden, he described how wisdom dictates simplicity of living, independence of mind, grandeur of soul, and trust in oneself &mdash; and he associated those virtues with winter, autumn, summer, and spring.</p>
<p>Living as he did in an agricultural society, he experienced the tensions between the seasons of nature and the seasons of human cultivation, and he knew that the ancient Roman writer Varro categorized the latter as preparing, planting, cultivating, harvesting, storing, and offering for sale.</p>
<p>His chosen profession of natural philosopher led him to spend countless hours and days observing the botanical stages of seed, sprout, tree, flower, fruit, leaf, and bud; thus he naturally likened those stages to the organic expression of human potential, which must be actively cultivated in order for one to reach fruition as an individual.</p>
<p>Blending these indications, we can see that perhaps the upland farm is located somewhere between a college town to the east (where one discovers self-trust in the springtime of one's life), a commercial city to the south (where one pursues grand summer designs of achievement and happiness), a farming community to the west (where one retires from more active affairs and engages in independent, autumnal reflection), and a wilderness area to the north (where one renounces worldly concerns and conducts a life of wintry simplicity).</p>
<p>Even after you find your upland farm, cultivating it is a deeply individual and often lonely pursuit. Not only narrow but rough is the way that leads to life everlasting; no broad and common road leads to the farm, only a footpath wide enough for one. There are no mechanical contrivances to be had; instead the upland farmer must work alongside nature while growing something even higher and better.</p>
<p>The harvest here is the rarest success: to achieve a balance between use and beauty, work and leisure, society and solitude, cooperation and independence, action and reflection, civilization and wildness, the real and the ideal, the practical and the transcendental &mdash; between the maintenance of your body and the maintenance of your soul.</p>
<p>To understand the aspirational experiments that Thoreau pursued at his upland farm, I have tapped the trees and boiled down the sweet sap of his books and essays, his poems and letters, and his vast journals; yet I have not stopped at syrup, but have gone on to procuring sugar from the new life that stirs in the roots and stems and leaves of his writings. These few pure crystals embody the transcendent idea that Thoreau pursued in all his works and days: the true poem of what he made of himself, the form and expression of his entire life, the highest use that he discovered and perfected in his independent existence.</p>

<h3>2. Seed (March 11)</h3>

<p>A seed is a small thing, almost invisible, hardly worth noticing. Yet it is a plant or tree in embryo; it has creative energy and the principle of life and growth within it.</p>
<p>Like the seed is the fruit. If you would eventually bear fruit of a divine flavor, you must pay close attention to learning the origins of your later seasons and to sowing such seeds as sincerity, truth, simplicity, faith, and innocence.</p>
<p>The simplest seed is awareness: awakening to life and its higher possibilities, seeking and finding personal liberation, attuning yourself with serenity and joy to the hope and expectation of greatness. This awareness is a morning invitation to simplicity and innocence, when you throw off the sleep of reason and elevate your life by conscious endeavor. Through a stern simplicity of life and elevation of purpose, you can make your life worthy of the contemplation of my most elevated and critical hour.</p>
<p>Just as bud follows hard upon leaf, so choice follows hard upon awareness. As an upland farmer, you reap what you sow and you must deliberately select the seeds of your liberation. The seed-time of your character shall produce nobler crops and better repay cultivation than the common stock, for only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence.</p>
<p>Thoreau likened a higher existence to a few particular plants and trees: the life-everlasting, the arbor vitae (tree of life), and the apples of the Hesperides &mdash; a mythical grove that could grant immortality to one who ate its golden fruit (parallel to the apples of the Norse goddess Iduna, which enabled the gods to stay ever-young).</p>
<p>In practice, choosing to cultivate crops of immortality meant, for Thoreau, living his idealism by hewing to a higher path, maintaining his individuality, keeping his own counsel, getting his living honestly, expecting of himself a nobler course of action in his daily existence. He had faith that these tiny seeds would eventually bear flowers and fruits of immortal beauty, and that, even if he never fully achieved his ideal, the benefits of idealism would accrue to him by producing an unconscious truthfulness and nobleness and beauty of life.</p>
<p>Thus are sown the seeds of a better life and a true success, steadying your pursuits and providing the foundation for a higher and more ethereal existence.</p>

<h3>3. Preparing (March 28)</h3>

<p>If the seeds of your life are to take root and thrive, you must first plan and prepare. Although Thoreau celebrated wildness, he recognized that the soul is not an unplowed meadow or an uncharted forest, but a garden or an orchard that requires constant tending.</p>
<p>So make ready: put on the pack of an upland farmer in good earnest. Know that the tools you can carry are few and small, but ancient and powerful. You must work with your hands, take advantage of what nature offers, and rely ultimately on yourself.</p>
<p>And keep your tools sharp: a spade for placing your seedlings down below the mud and slush of opinion and prejudice and tradition and appearance; a hoe for weeding out the many and inevitable distractions of life in modern society; an axe for pruning back the fast-growing branches of your desires and thus for living more simply; a pail for meting out the water of attention onto what truly matters.</p>
<p>The upland farmer also requires more rarified skills and aptitudes: mindful attention and being forever on the alert; sincerity and honesty in your dealings with yourself, and a critical eye to perceive whether you are ripe or rotten; calm patience and unwearied persistence and a sturdy discipline; and an endless curiosity about all the varied phenomena of life.</p>
<p>The transcendentalists such as Thoreau used these tools in applying the methods of living they valued most: self-knowledge and contemplation, studious reading in all the great traditions of human thought, and keen observation of nature and society.</p>
<p>Thus does the upland farmer prepare to ply his trade.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>4. Sprout (April 19)</h3>

<p>Late in life, while performing research into forest ecology, Thoreau noticed that trees which shoot up from stumps or roots are not as vigorous as those which begin in seeds; the shoots inherit the diseases of their parents, whereas the seedlings are thoroughly original and have an organic resilience and elasticity.</p>
<p>Thus the importance, for Thoreau, of growing your own roots and of listening to the faintest but constant suggestions of your own genius. Not for him the grafting of parent stock and the repetition of old errors; instead he preferred to grow resolutely wild and faithful to his own nature, to seek new adventures, to make new discoveries, to try new experiments in living and doing, to have the enterprise and faith to live free.</p>
<p>So also he approached the year, welcoming the hope and promise of spring, feeling his prospects brightened by the influx of better thoughts, nurturing some innocent fair shoots that would try another year's life &mdash; tender and fresh as the youngest plant.</p>
<p>So too he approached each day, awakening in an atmosphere of divine dreams, rising free from care before the dawn, blessing his whole day with a morning walk, returning again and again to goodness and simplicity, taking pleasure in the most glorious season of the day. As the sun rose he said to himself: "Let us be faithful all round; we will do justice and receive it."</p>
<p>At the lowland farm there are raised beds and greenhouses to protect your seedlings from exposure to excessive rains and late frosts; yet at the upland farm it is not so easy to dodge the pressures of conformity and to maintain your own recovered innocence. It takes a true strength of spirit to spring up and forward with vigor and energy and hope in the future.</p>
<p>For Thoreau, the true harvest of your daily life is to explore your own higher latitudes: the upper regions of thought, the continents and seas of the moral world, the private sea of one's being alone. He turned his back on wealth and power and success so that he could be the lord of a celestial empire within him. Although he felt sympathy with all living things, his greatest sympathy was with the spirit that animated his own clay and his greatest obedience was to yet more sacred laws and to the laws of his own being.</p>
<p>The germ and kernel of what you will leave behind in the autumn of your life or year or day is to be found in the leaves that sprout in the earliest spring, when the sap runs in your limbs and life buds in your furthest extremities. The impulse and the impetus of your life is found in each moment, for to affect the quality of the day is the highest of arts; and it is through the never-ending accumulation of moments that you feed the countless rootlets forming the foundation of your higher being. Blessed are those who live in the present always, for they remember their creator in the days of their youth and ever see the world with youthful, early-opened, hopeful eyes.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>5. Planting (May 6)</h3>

<p>It sounds so easy to follow your genius and obey the spur of the moment. Yet Thoreau recognized that there is a great and deep self-discipline here.</p>
<p>To plant is to found, to provide with a grounding in the bedrock realities and necessities of life. This is a natural foundation, not a conventional life merely but a human grounding in the very humus of the earth. The seed may fly freely on the slightest wind, but to become a mighty tree the seedling must become deeply rooted.</p>
<p>Thoreau believed that castles deserve to be built in the air, like the eyrie of an eagle that serves as a jumping-off point for this noble bird to sport with proud self-reliance in the fields of the sky. Yet this castle needs a foundation &mdash; and what better foundation for such great-hearted pursuits than the topmost branches of a lofty tree such as the tree of life itself?</p>
<p>To gain strength for this greatest flourishing, you must select and establish the core aspects of your way of life &mdash; where you live, how you live, with whom you live &mdash; and settle into those choices. By drawing sustenance from the air and sun and soil that surround you, you build the first roots and tender growth of your essence and identity, achieving solidity and structure through a morning faith and trust in the future.</p>
<p>It is one thing to speak of advancing confidently in the direction of your dreams and endeavoring to live the life you have imagined; it is quite another to figure out how to do so. Thoreau always maintained that the right path to a higher life can be found in a life that is outwardly simply but inwardly complex: in pruning back your desires, weeding out distractions, attending to what truly matters, and living earnestly. Life, he knew, is a serious business &mdash; the kind of private business he transacted at Walden Pond &mdash; and the upland farmer will strain every fiber of his moral and intellectual capacity to live simply and earnestly, and to attain the right object of living.</p>
<p>Cultivating the upland farm is thus in large measure a matter of refraining from what is unimportant: of knowing what is absolutely necessary for your highest growth and focusing your energies where they truly count. Yoking yourself to this kind of self-restraint, self-mastery, and self-discipline is essentially similar to the yogic practices of the ancient Indian philosophers Thoreau so admired, for he said that at times even he was a yogin. Yet this discipline is not imposed from without &mdash; it is a higher law nurtured inside, turned over and over in the receptive soil of your essential being, coming near to making a new world within.</p>
<p>This discipline of securing the most from life starts from what you have: improving from day to day the soil beneath your feet, harvesting whatever crop your life already yields, taking care to watch closely over the fruit of your thoughts and experience. When you do not strain to reach a fruit that is too far beyond your grasp, slowly you shoot upward with ever-expanding confidence; in the same proportion that you root yourself firmly in the earth, so also you rise into the heavens above and bear a nobler fruit at last in the air and light, far from the ground.</p>
<p>The everyday work of the soul requires a great pile of doing to gain a small diameter of being. One truly experienced moment of life requires countless hours of preparation toward the highest, most elevating goals we know.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>6. Tree (May 20)</h3>

<p>In the perfect days of late spring and early adulthood, you engage in your first, urgent growth toward your ideals: rooting downward, branching upward, leafing outward.</p>
<p>By focusing on the root and radicle of your existence, you burrow down below the mere surface of things and ally yourself with human nature and the humus of the earth.</p>
<p>By maintaining a scrupulous honesty with yourself, the stem of your identity becomes solid and steadfast.</p>
<p>By pursuing your highest, greenest potential, you increase the genial heat of what you will leave behind later in life and thus provide a benevolent shade to those beneath you.</p>
<p>In these three ways does your spirit unfold, representing an expansion of the ideal into the actual. You achieve a depth of understanding, a height of character, and a breadth of creativity. You find an an abundance of life and health, an everlasting vigor and serenity, and an expectation of perpetual untarnished morning. You embrace your fate and, instead of experiencing suffering or indifference, your enjoy and bless your existence, and the day and the night are such that you greet them with joy.</p>
<p>The true, living poetry of your life is like this tree, whose leaves precede the flower and fruit. It is what you become through your work, and how your ideals achieve form and expression in what you leave behind every day and year of your life.</p>
<p>Yet this spring growth into a more rarified air is often checked by the disappointments of experience. Some blast of residual cold threatens the kernel of your life from ripening. The challenge is to not allow such a crisis to keep you from finding your second growth in the autumn of your life, from bearing your fruit at last, from doing the work that only you can do, from propagating intellectually and morally.</p>
<p>It is this that you achieve when you cultivate the tree which you have found to bear fruit in your soil. Although it is tempting to venture far away from your roots in order to achieve greatness, Thoreau counsels that you do not need to go not so far out of your way in order to lead a truer life. Instead, keep strictly onward in that path alone which your genius points out. Do the things which lie nearest to you, but which are difficult to do. Live a purer, a more thoughtful and laborious life, more true to your friends and neighbors, more noble and magnanimous. Thus do you track yourself through life, always on the trail of your deepest nature.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>7. Trust (May 28)</h3>

<p>For Thoreau, trust was primarily self-trust, and even more important than trusting yourself was to be worthy of trust. Ever on the alert for natural and linguistic connections, Thoreau was no doubt aware that trust, truth, troth, and tree share a common root. To be worthy of trust is to be as firm and straight as a tree, to be true to your nature, to be trothed to integrity, to be sincere in your dealings with yourself, to be loyal to a life of principle, to be obedient to higher laws.</p>
<p>These higher laws are the laws of your own being; they are not imposed from without, but deliberately chosen and obediently followed within. It is the license of your higher being to establish new laws around and within you &mdash; such laws as purity, chastity, and temperance. These laws much harder to live up to than the laws of men, and they point toward the possibility of a divine life. Even though a divine life is not open to mere mortals, you can capture some of that ethereal quality by practicing an inward and outward austerity, by letting your mind descend into your body and redeem it, by treating yourself with ever increasing respect. This is partly what Thoreau means by advancing confidently in the direction of your dreams and living the life you have imagined.</p>
<p>By fearlessly living out your own essential nature, you connect your life to the divine even if it is, in the end, unattainable. Few are those who contemplate their highest possibilities, who pursue some crowning experiences above and beyond those that the merely common laws might approve, who seek out a revolution in their own inner lives.</p>
<p>Devotion to the divine and cultivation of the right way of living require self-discipline and self-restraint. There are similarities here to the ancient Vedantic concept of <em>brahmacharya</em> or studenthood, the first phase of life in which one dedicates oneself to deep learning and simple living.</p>
<p>Growing up as it does in the nurturing environment of youth, self-trust might seem opposed to a mature independence. As hinted, perhaps a balance can be found here by imagining the upland farm as located between a college town to the east and a farming community to the west. To find the right away of living, even while building self-trust in one's youth one must also seek out opportunities for reflection and for thinking independently of one's family, one's teachers, and one's peers.</p>
<p>Self-trust builds on all the attainments of your early life: aspiration, awareness, deliberation, originality, discipline, steadfastness, integrity, sincerity. It is, as it were, the crown of the spring virtues, bursting forth with hope and confidence in the future, growing naturally alongside the emergence of self and your own firm identity.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>8. Flower (June 16)</h3>

<p>The root and stem and leaves &mdash; your depth and uprightness and benevolence, and the self-trust that grows from them &mdash; provide the beginnings of a beautiful and winged life that fulfills great expectations and that is a blessing to mankind. Thoreau challenges you to a goodness that is not a partial and transitory act, but a complete and constant superfluity; when you flow and flower in courage and health and ease, your life gives off a fragrance that is not merely useful, but an unconscious ethical beauty and moral purity that inspires those around you, that enhances the general sweetness of the atmosophere, that enriches the world with your visions and joys.</p>
<p>The beauty and purity of which he speaks comprise the uncompromising principles and consistent self-control that enable you to achieve nobility and magnanimity, to produce works of unsurpassing value, to pluck every flower of thought, to prove every sentiment it is possible to experience. The great task of existence is to get the most life, to extract honey from the flower of the world. Thoreau urges you to make <em>that</em> your every-day business, and to be busy as a bee about it &mdash; to be, indeed, both the flower and the bee, both the creator of a perfect summer life and its most industrious gatherer. It is the greatest success to live so that only the most beautiful wild-flowers will spring up where you have dwelt.</p>
<p>To bloom and flourish so exquisitely, you must transcend and translate yourself, as does the caterpillar that metamorphoses into a butterfly. Consider the famous dream of Taoist philosopher Chuang Tzu, in which he wondered how he could distinguish whether he was Chuang Tzu dreaming that he was a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming that he was Chuang Tzu. In "Higher Laws" Thoreau speculates that the answer is perhaps you can be both, by preserving your higher or poetic faculties in the best condition, and by rising above a merely physical, grubbing existence to a perfect state of being in which you fly freely and happily, sipping the sweetest and most ethereal forms of sustenenace while at the same time spreading pollen from flower to flower and thus creating your higher self.</p>
<p>This metamorphosis and living up to your highest potential is inspired most of all by love and by friendship. In love we impart the best of ourselves and alone perceive the truest fragrance of the beloved. In friendship can be found the highest fruit which the year may bear, and which lends its fragrance to life. This essential fragrance is the best of ourselves, the ripe thoughts and atmosphere that comprise the crop of crops and that refresh and encourage us not for a moment but for a lifetime. Thoreau found such inspiration in his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson (despite the eventual and perhaps inevitable cooling of their relationship), in Ellen Sewell (to whom he unsuccessfully proposed marriage but whom he still professed to love in the last months of his life), in his brother John and sister Sophia, and in his other close family and friends. Even though Thoreau never married or had children, in many ways he still realized the ancient Indian ideal of <em>grihastha</em> by actively upholding not only his family's household but also for a number of years that of his friend Emerson; and these responsibilities reinforced his highest ambitions.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>9. Cultivating (July 12)</h3>

<p>The upland farm requires active care and intentional guidance, for the tree of life needs water and sunlight and air and space to grow.</p>
<p>Water is like attention: by lavishing attention on what is important, I ensure that I focus on what truly matters. No method nor discipline can supersede the necessity of being forever on the alert, even or especially with regard to myself, for self-deception is the easiest thing in the world.</p>
<p>Sunlight is like knowledge, especially self-knowledge: by understanding what is possible to me, I live more earnestly and I receive enlightenment with trust and magnanimity. Although it is true that the sun shines equally upon the lowland farm and the upland farm, the upland light is more regular and pure, since it is unobstructed by the mists and fogs common to the lowlands.</p>
<p>Air is like freedom, for upland air makes free: by pruning back my fears and desires, I leave myself more room for higher pursuits and nurture superior virtues within myself.</p>
<p>Space is like solitude: by forming an intimate aquaintance with the weeds that grow in the soil of my life and the vices that grow in my soul, I am more able to pull them up and thus pursue experiences of significance and opportunities for personal growth.</p>
<p>Cultivating attention and self-knowledge and freedom and solitude is in large measure the regular work I engage in to hone my being and nurture each day a still fresher soul within me. For the soul has a certain magnetism in it, which attracts the power or virtue that gives it life, and which is the reason for all the labor I expend to sustain it. The finest tools I can wield are imagination and reason and belief, which enable a new creation and pasturage of thought within me - the most solid wealth and the most real estate of my living on earth. This is the highest discipline and truest work of the soul, a kind of <em>karma yoga</em> on the great field of the self. The motive of one who toils in this field of a wholly new life is do this work well, for the love of the work alone.</p>
<p>Yet, although Thoreau calls me to do some work every day to show for my ecstasy or despondency, at Walden Pond sometimes he spent the entire morning in contemplation, forsaking works entirely. Even then, however, the day advanced as if to shed light on some work of his. Was there not a tension in his life between the hardworking poet-naturalist (who authored perhaps 10,000 pages) and the town idler who never held a steady job? He counseled: "Do your work, and finish it. If you know how to begin, you will know when to end." Before sunrise and long after sunset he was studying at his desk or in the woods, and the result was a singular cheerfulness. He was always busy about learning the trade of life, working out a true life for himself - an effort that requires more art and delicate skill than any other work. Instead of turning out silver by the cartload, he preferred to mine the gold that was known only to him high up on the uplands of his life - to cultivate the noblest of crops and to get the most honest living he could.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>10. Magnanimity (August 6)</h3>

<p>Ever attuned to the course of the seasons, Thoreau was keenly aware of the longer and cooler nights of August, when the year starts to descend the long slope toward winter. A new urgency accompanies this afternoon of the year: no longer can you afford to postpone the fulfillment of your hopes in a future and anticipated nobleness, but it is past time to pursue a true life and to take courage in reaching for high flourishing, noble ambition, riotous growth, overflowing life, and a faster progression toward one's ideal.</p>
<p>Thoreau called this magnanimity, in its ancient sense of grandeur of soul. He knew that the anima is the vital spirit: that which forms the basis for character and personality, that which enables you to grow outward from within. To be great hearted and high minded is to give no thought and have no need for mere ornament, but to achieve an unconscious nobleness and truthfulness of character and life, to accept an invitation to be what you are, which is something noble and worthy. The upland farm will produce nobler crops, and better repay cultivation in the long run.</p>
<p>The great challenge, in the afternoon of life, is to keep up an atmosphere of perpetual morning and the great expectations of your youth, to try what noble life you can, to reinvigorate and morally reform the very medium of your existence, to maintain your life with dignity and sincerity, to burst the bonds of despair and realize the full grandeur of your destiny, to find elevation in every hour, to exercise your highest human faculties, to make your life, even in its details, worthy of the contemplation of your most elevated and critical hour. It is to advance into the career of life with the equanimity of nature, silent and patient and unpretending; to move onward through your midday with earnest toil and a lofty and serene countenance; to get ready, through the accumulated deed of the day, a rich western blaze against the evening of your life - in short, it is to have a fresh dawn, and a great noon, and a serene sunset in yourself.</p>
<p>In the summertime of life and the royal month of August you spend your greatest life energy in an outdoor life that is all for action. Yet Thoreau counsels that there is no need to venture far from the core and heart of your life in some frontier country: instead cultivate the field on which you find yourself, and do the things that lie nearest to you but that are difficult to do. It is more than enough to breathe your self, to give voice to a free life and free expression without bounds, to rise above sects and parties. The essence of your person can be found in your best thoughts; by honoring this, you honor the freedom to think sacredly and create devotedly - a freedom from fear, from perturbation, from prejudice. When you honor the immutable laws of integrity and magnanimity, you hold to an inward light that makes you able to appreciate what noble deeds are done by your compatriots on this earth.</p>
<p>Thoreau went to Walden Pond to transact some private business, and to do so greatly and unhurriedly. He avowed that when you are unhurried and wise, your perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence, that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of reality, and that your proper pursuit and high calling is to root yourself firmly in the earth only so that you can in the same proportion rise into the heavens above. When you do so, you live in relations of truth and sincerity: a purer, more thoughtful and laborious life, more true to your friends and neighbors, more noble and magnanimous.</p>
<p>This active pursuit of a noble life is the seeming opposite of the simplicity that Thoreau so cherished. Yet in the end it is congruent with his acceptance and knowledge of the seasons. The cycles of work and rest, growth and harvest, are just as natural to the day and the year of the individual as they are to Nature herself. No one part of the cycle of life provides complete fulfillment; and if in the summer of life you approach the upland farm from a commercial town to the south, bustling with activity and ambition, this provides but one direction and path to a higher life.</p>

<li>the fruit of a tree is the highest use to which it can be put (1859-03-07)</li>
<li>The phenomena of ripeness: color, mellowness, perfectness. A higher ripeness that addresses the taste for beauty.</li>
<li>to "live simply and wisely"</li>
<li>"I want the flower and fruit of a man." ("some ripeness") ... goodness as a "constant superfluity" ... "a simple and irrepressible satisfaction with gift of life", "be as simple and well as Nature", "endeavor to become one of the worthies of the world"</li>
<li>Also ch 9: "the fruits do not yield their true flavor"; "the ambrosial and essential part of the fruit is lost with the bloom"</li>
<li>Also ch 9 on the true fruit of Flint's Pond (and of White's Pond: a beautiful life and a transparent character)</li>
<li>To have some spare capital and superfluous vigor in respect to your spirit and imagination, which is true wealth and independence. A free and adventurous spirit, and a reserve of elasticity and strength. A spirit that pervades and controls the body, and transmutes it into purity and devotion.</li>
<li>See mention of fruit (and flower) in ch 11</li>
<li>And "bearing for fruit his brain only, like the nut its kernel" (ch 14)</li>
<li>one is prevented from doing one's proper and finer work - a true integrity day to day - by a lack of moderation and continence, occupied as one is with factitious cares and coarse labors</li>
<li>fruits such as genius and heroism and holiness (all of them a flowing to god)</li>
<li>to be ripe is to be perfected and to serve a transcendent use - not a means to a higher end, but an end in itself (consider: the transcendent use of John Brown)</li>
<li>Not a delicious but ephemeral springtime fruit like the strawberry, but a lasting food that is hardened by the sun of summer and the coolness of autumn</li>
<li>"The ultimate expression or fruit of any created thing is a fine effluence which only the most ingenuous worshipper perceives at a reverent distance from its surface even. The cause and the effect are equally evanescent and intangible, and the former must be investigated in the same spirit and with the same reverence with which the latter is perceived. Science is often like the grub which, though it may have nestled in the germ of a fruit, has merely blighted or consumed it and never truly tasted it. Only that intellect makes any progress toward conceiving of the essence which at the same time perceives the effluence."</li>
<li>The ambrosial and essential part of the fruit, its true flavor, is imparted only to the one who raises and plucks that fruit for its own sake - for it is too pure to have a purely market value.</li>
<li>"Suppose I see a single green apple, brought to perfection on some thorny shrub, far in a wild pasture where no cow has plucked it. It is an agreeable surprise. What chemistry has been work there? It affects me somewhat like a work of art. I see some shrubs which cattle have browsed for twenty years, keeping them down and compelling them to spread, until at last they are so broad they become their own fence and some interior shoot darts upward and bears its fruit! What a lesson to man! So are human beings, referred to the highest standard, the celestial fruit which they suggest and aspire to bear, browsed on by fate, and only the most persistent and strongest genius prevails, defends itself, sends a tender scion upward at last, and drops its perfect fruit on the ungrateful earth; and that fruit, though somewhat smaller, perchance, is essentially the same in flavor as if it had grown in a garden. That fruit seems all the sweeter and more palatable even for the very difficulties it has contended with."</li>
<li>This celestial fruit, this golden apple of the Hesperides, is the pursuit of knowledge (esp. of self-knowledge).</li>
<li>Is your trade with the celestial empire that produces these celestial fruits? This trade requires strict business habits, and labors that task your highest human faculties, and a universal knowledge. Confucius said, "To know that we know what we know, and that we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge."</li>
<li>October: when everything about you is ripe and glows with maturity, from root to stem to leaves (i.e., depth, uprightness, benevolence), when you are no longer dependent on your transient moods, when all your experience ripens into wisdom, when everything you have been and have done in the spring and summer of your life bears its fruit at last in the air and light.</li>

<h3>12. Harvesting (September 18)</h3>

<ul>
<li>theme: gratitude for existence and the present moment</li>
<li>akin to "plucking" (Latin carpere as in carpe diem)</li>
<li>ripe = "ready to be cut"</li>
<li>reaping what you have sowed</li>
<li>a late and perfect maturity</li>
<li>a ripening of existence</li>
<li>a certain mellowness and stronger flavor to life</li>
<li>an Indian-summer serenity</li>
<li>to mature is to "come to [one's] growth" (Spring)</li>
<li>an appreciation of beauty separate from usefulness</li>
<li>testing for ripeness / observing oneself</li>
<li>self knowledge</li>
<li>gathering together</li>
<li>harvest - but an individual harvest</li>
<li>celebration of achievements</li>
<li>thanksgiving</li>
<li>an inward verdure</li>
<li>a wholly new life</li>
<li>slowing pace of life</li>
<li>the movement of life indoors again (warmth of home life)</li>
<li>looking back more than forward</li>
<li>a calm September afternoon in which the surface of the lake is as smooth as glass: "The thrills of joy and thrills of pain are undistinguishable." (Ponds chapter) note connection to Taoism ... serenity, purity, liquid joy and happiness, etc... it has gained a wonderful purity by living reserved and austere like a hermit in the woods</li>
<li>"if one listens to the faintest but constant suggestions of his genius" and "grows more resolute and faithful", then "the day and the night are such that you greet them with joy" - this is "success" and "the true harvest of my daily life" (Walden, Higher Laws)</li>
<li>"The fields are reaped and shorn of their pride, but an inward verdure still crowns them. The thistle scatters its down on the pool, and yellow leaves clothe the vine, and naught disturbs the serious life of men. But behind the sheaves, and under the sod, there lurks a ripe fruit, which the reapers have not gathered, the true harvest of the year, which it bears forever, annually watering and maturing it, and man never severs the stalk which bears this palatable fruit."</li>
<li>Gather a rich crop of experience.</li>
<li>Gratitude for rest and for toil.</li>
<li>Confidently and heartily live up to your thought (if in error, you learn; if not, you progress).</li>
<li>Gentleness and a humble gratitude for the tree that bears the fruit that feeds or shadows me. The practice of justice and innocence and a greater humanity. Just as true for the tree of life and the fruit of myself.</li>
<li>Harvest the scarlet leaves of thought planted in the seed-time of character. Some maturity and flavor in your thoughts and acts.</li>
<li>Thoughts that have acquired consistency and hardness as well as a concentrated flavor and a mellow  ripeness.</li>
<li>Harvest that crop which your life yields.</li>
<li>Harvest as early as possible if you would escape the frosts.</li>
<li>The true harvest of daily life is like the most subtle tints of morning and evening.</li>
<li>If you are not happy on a harvest day, you will not be so tomorrow. And is not every day a harvest day?</li>
<li>Do not spend your time atoning for the neglect of past opportunities, but even in the evening of your days allow your prospect to brighten on the influx of better thoughts. Daily recover your innocence through serene work in the true field of life and self. Live in the present with a pure morning joy, for this season, too, is a season of growth, a second spring.</li>
<li>A rejuvenescence and faith in the current time.</li>
<li>Launch yourself on every wave. Find your eternity in each moment. Know what game to play today, and play it. Postpone no opportunities. Look not to some other land; for there is no other land, no other life. Take any other course, and life will be a succession of regrets. Harvest, harvest, harvest!</li>

<li>Do not let your work or lifestyle become an interruption or hindrance to your true course and highest goal.</li>
<li>Be wealthy and independent in respect to your spirits and imagination, have spare capital and superfluous vigor, giving you a reserve of elasticity and strength to go beyond your ordinary limits. If you are not cramped by spiritual debts, you have the freedom to spend your time and energy as you see fit, and to enjoy the gift of life and taste its true flavor.</li>
<li>A heroic spirit that dreams of remoter retirements and more rugged paths, that is wise and ready to live a self-reliant and independent existence.</li>
<li>Whereas cultivated fruits depend altogether on our care and planting, wild apples emulate human independence and enterprise.</li>
<li>Simple, honest, independent labor frees you from all enervating luxuries.</li>

<h3>14. Leaf (October 17)</h3>

<ul>
<li>theme: reflection</li>
<li>"what is peeled or stripped off"</li>
<li>what you leave behind</li>
<li>spiritual inheritance </li>
<li>Iliad quote</li>
<li>Autumnal Tints</li>
<li>in practice, how to turn the slough and dross of my experience into humus that enriches the soil for growth? among other things, learning from mistakes (my own and others'). But there is also value in learning from <em>successes</em>.</li>
<li>each day and year brings new "leavings" and new opportunities for learning</li>
<li>several methods here: reading, biography, friendship, family, social observation</li>
<li>humus/homo = earth/man</li>
<li>the vibrant color and beauty of autumnal tints; being a "sugar maple man" in the fall, too</li>
<li>"reading of another's experience"</li>
<li>"the earth expresses itself outwardly in leaves"</li>
<li>"the change to some higher color in a leaf is an evidence that it has arrived at a late and perfect maturity"</li>
<li>benevolence, superfluity, unconscious philanthropy</li>
<li>soil is like inner strength; I nourish the roots of my being with a natural fertilizer formed of the slough and dross of my experience and learning (cf. Thoreau on leaves)</li>
<li>To lie down and take leave of life as gracefully as the leaves do.</li>
<li>Doing what we do best or most perfectly, what we have most thoroughly learned by the longest practice, what has grown organically from seeds planted early in life. Such actions falls from us unconsciously, as the leaf falls from the tree. Flow. Superfluity.</li>
<li>To leave behind a poem (i.e., the life you have lived) in which future generations can delight, as a mould that nourishes the future tree of life.</li>
<li>The leaf, having been perfected, leaves the tree and has its own independent existence. The action, having been perfected, leaves the self and has its own independent existence. The poem of life as an independent creation. The true poem of life what you have become through your work, through the pursuit of your highest use - how the idea obtains form and expression in your own life.</li>
<li>Yet even afterward the stem, too, ripens, especially the young twigs, which experience a secong spring of shooting growth.</li>
<li>A ripe old age in which one is ready to  be reaped.</li>
<li>In the economy of Nature, nothing is wasted, everything is put to use, every decayed leaf and twig and fibre serves as compost for future growth.</li>
<li>A successful life is a complete maturity, a ripening from leaf to root - when your entire being blooms as one flower - when you finish your summer's work, ripen your seeds, rejoice in your existence, experience unalloyed reflections, faithfully discharge your duties, neglect none of your economies, add to your stature in human virtue, grow steadily toward heaven all your life, and deserve well of humanity.</li>
<li>An Indian summer of finer atmosphere of pensive beauty. As in Walden, a time of Oriental contemplation, of springlike faith and serene confidence.</li>
<li>An anticipation of spring, an evidence of warmth and genialness, a preparation for passing from this life into another.</li>
<li>Experiencing pure and distinct reflections, and thoughts that are a foretaste of the spring.</li>
</ul>

<h3>15. Storing (November 17)</h3>

<p>On cold November days, I provide for coming dormancy by cultivating a renewed focus on the essentials of life. I put things on a winter footing and find a certain broad pause and opportunity to start again, to turn over a new leaf even after the few remaining leaves of summer have come fluttering down.</p>
<p>Yet the prospect of winter does not lead to a bleak and cheerless resignation, because the true harvest of the day, of the year, of life is to be found not in the sweet, ripe fruit which it yields, but in the concentrated, nutty kernel of thought which it occasions. This is a matter not of plucking each fruit as it passes, but of gathering a rich crop of experience and growth, cheerfully threshing the grain and separating the kernel from the chaff, picking over the choicest specimens of what I am and aspire to be, and storing these safely in my bin.</p>
<p>By making a faithful record of my strivings and learnings, the things I love, my affection for any aspect of the world, and what I love to think of, I store it for future use and can restore it again at will through the faculty of imagination. The reminiscence affects me as poetry and enables me to appreciate that other season of life, that ripe and mellow moment, that experience and mood. Thus only the rarest flower, the purest melody, of the season comes down to me. The world so seen is all one spring, full of beauty.</p>
<p>It is never too late to slough off my errors and give up my prejudices, to insist upon proof for my ways of thinking and doing, to purify myself of the dross and earthiness which I have accumulated during my works and days.</p>
<p>I aspire to practice in succession all the honest arts of life, and late in the day the best of these is through sincere and searing reflection: to settle my accounts, to admit whether or not I have lived deliberately and have been well employed, to give tone and firmness and consistency to my thought and my actions. And if in my most elevated and critical house I find my life unworthy, let not my experience wear upon me, but, encouraged, let me set out again to climb the mountain of the earth and seek a future is worth expecting.</p>
<p>However, this discipline of self-knowledge is, like the jñāna yoga of the Vedas, not a matter of constraint and severity. Thoreau may have been a sort of natural Stoic, but his was a cheerful wisdom. He learned to live, to make few apologies: "Be resolutely and faithfully what you are; be humbly what you aspire to be."</p>

<hr/>

<h3>16. Simplicity (December 7)</h3>
<ul>
<li>"something with one fold"</li>
<li>an unfolding of oneself</li>
<li>also ply = to use, wield, practice consistently or diligently</li>
<li>ply a single heavenly trade</li>
<li>focus on essentials </li>
<li>"that economy of living which is synonymous with philosophy"</li>
<li>not for the sake of simplicity itself, but clearing the ground for something higher</li>
<li>crown of the winter virtues</li>
<li>describe other winter virtues as well</li>
<li>influence of Stoics and Hinduism</li>
<li>dispersion of seeds </li>
<li>dormancy in all its meanings</li>
<li>existence is stripped to its essentials and simplest elements</li>
<li>essential simplicity as having few wants, having true needs, also being earnest and sincere</li>
<li>"The wonderful purity of nature at this season is a most pleasing fact."</li>
<li>"a perennial waveless serenity"</li>
<li>"inexpressible tenderness and fragile delicacy"</li>
<li>"cool and even temperament"</li>
<li>"Heaven is under our feet is well as over our heads."</li>
<li>Find spiritual wealth through simplicity and naturalness: sweep away the superfluous, focus on the essential laws of existence, and take what nature has to give you.</li>
<li>Give the best of your wares, a very real and earnest life, a sincerity and plainness in how you live.</li>
<li>Only those can withstand the cold and searching winds of December who have a pure and steadfast virtue, a sturdy innocence, a Puritan toughness, and such valor as God himself - those who live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that is not life.</li>
<li>Unless you do more than simply learn the trade of your time, you are but a skillful apprentice, and not yet a master workman of the art of life.</li>
<li>Men do not fail commonly for want of knowledge, but for want of prudence to give wisdom the preference. What we need to know in any case is very simple.</li>
<li>Do not play life, or study it merely, but earnestly live it from beginning to end. How better learn to live than by at once trying the experiment of living? Actively educate yourself in that economy of living which is synonymous with philosophy, instead of merely professing.</li>
<li>To simplify the problem of life, it is necessary to distinguish the necessary and the real. Turn away from superficial and trivial desires toward aspirations for a better character and a higher, nobler life.</li>
<li>A rigid economy, a stern and more than Spartan simplicity of life, an honesty and elevation of purpose. Let your affairs be as two or three, not a hundred or a thousand. Life is frittered away on details, ruined by luxury and heedless expense.</li>
<li>Attending to trivial things (routines, conventions, manners, and the like) dissipates and impoverishes the mind  and robs it of strength and simplicity.</li>
<li>The highest development and employment is simplicity through wisdom and the cultivation of the highest faculties. If you spend all your time working for common luxuries and outward refinements, or even for knowledge and culture as conventionally defined, you have no time to experience profound thoughts and inward complexity. The former is a voluntary enslavement, the latter an essential freedom.</li>
<li>Invest in your higher self and let your capital be simplicity, serenity, and contentment.</li>
<li>"It is the greatest of all advantages to enjoy no advantage at all."</li>
<li>This seeming poverty, this simplification of lifestyle and paucity of experiences, this withdrawal from human society and worldly concerns, is in fact a concentration of strength and energy and flavor that fits me for spiritual abundance and a higher society - the sweet friendship of the seasons, the most innocent and divinely encouraging society in every natural object and in universal nature.</li>
<li>When, as in the Laws of Manu, the questions to be decided are as simple as how to eat and drink and sleep, then we realize that our natural wants are easily and gracefully satisfied.</li>
<li>A simple, wholesome, true relation to nature grants us health and happiness and inspiration and a hundred other far finer and nobler fruits than the mere products of human enterprise.</li>
<li>The active business of life furnishes nothing on which the eye of reason can rest.</li>
<li>Our serene moments are simply a transient realization of what might be the whole tenor of our lives.</li>
<li>"Sometimes we are clarified and calmed healthily, as we never were before in our lives, not by an opiate, but by some unconscious obedience to the all-just laws so that we become like a still lake of purest crystal and without an effort our depths are revealed to ourselves."</li>
<li>To derive my satisfactions and inspirations from the most common events and everyday phenomena, so that I may dream of no heaven but that which lies about me.</li>
<li>seeming opposite of magnanimity?</li>
<li>approaching the upland farm from a wilderness to the north (winter / renunciation / sannyasa)</li>
</ul>

<p>To our nearsightedness this mere outward life seems a constituent part of us, and we do not realize that as our soul expands it will cast off the shell of routine and convention, which afterward will only be an object for the cabinets of the curious. But of this people the temples are now crumbled away, and we are introduced to the very hearth of Hindoo life and to the primeval conventicle where how to eat and to drink and to sleep were the questions to be decided.</p>
<p>The simple life herein described confers on us a degree of freedom even in the perusal. We throw down our packs and go on our way unencumbered. Wants so easily and gracefully satisfied that they seem like a more refined pleasure and repleteness.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, August 30, 1841</p>

<p>Men do not fail commonly for want of knowledge, but for want of prudence to give wisdom the preference. What we need to know in any case is very simple. It is but too easy to establish another durable and harmonious routine. Immediately all parts of nature consent to it. Only make something to take the place of something, and men will behave as if it was the very thing they wanted. They <em>must</em> behave, at any rate, and will work up any material. There is always a present and extant life, be it better or worse, which all combine to uphold. We should be slow to mend, my friends, as slow to require mending, "Not hurling, according to the oracle, a transcendent foot towards piety." The language of excitement is at best picturesque merely. You must be calm before you can utter oracles. What was the excitement of the Delphic priestess compared with the calm wisdom of Socrates?—or whoever it was that was wise. &mdash;Enthusiasm is a supernatural serenity.</p>
<blockquote>
"Men find that action is another thing<br/>
Than what they in discoursing papers read;<br/>
The world's affairs require in managing<br/>
More arts than those wherein you clerks proceed."<br/>
</blockquote>
<p>As in geology, so in social institutions, we may discover the causes of all past change in the present invariable order of society. The greatest appreciable physical revolutions are the work of the light-footed air, the stealthy-paced water, and the subterranean fire. Aristotle said, "As time never fails, and the universe is eternal, neither the Tanais nor the Nile can have flowed forever." We are independent of the change we detect. The longer the lever the less perceptible its motion. It is the slowest pulsation which is the most vital. The hero then will know how to wait, as well as to make haste. All good abides with him who waiteth <em>wisely</em>; we shall sooner overtake the dawn by remaining here than by hurrying over the hills of the west. Be assured that every man's success is in proportion to his <em>average</em> ability. The meadow flowers spring and bloom where the waters annually deposit their slime, not where they reach in some freshet only. A man is not his hope, nor his despair, nor yet his past deed. We know not yet what we have done, still less what we are doing. Wait till evening, and other parts of our day's work will shine than we had thought at noon, and we shall discover the real purport of our toil. As when the farmer has reached the end of the furrow and looks back, he can tell best where the pressed earth shines most.</p>
<p>&mdash;A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, "Monday"</p>

<p>Why will not I, having common sense, write in plain English always; <em>teach</em> men in detail how to live a simpler life, etc.; not go off into &mdash;&mdash;? But I say that I have no scheme about it &mdash; no designs on men at all; and, if I had, my mode would be to tempt them with the fruit, and not with the manure. To what end do I lead a simple life at all, pray? That I may teach others to simplify their lives?&mdash;and so all our lives be <em>simplified</em> merely, like an algebraic formula? Or not, rather, that I may make use of the ground I have cleared, to live more worthily and profitably? I would fain lay the most stress forever on that which is the most important &mdash; imports the most to me &mdash; though it were only (what it is likely to be) a vibration in the air. As a preacher, I should be prompted to tell men, not so much how to get their wheat bread cheaper, as of the bread of life compared with which <em>that</em> is bran. Let a man only taste these loaves, and he becomes a skillful economist at once. He'll not waste much time in earning those. Don't spend your time in drilling soldiers, who may turn out hirelings after all, but give to undrilled peasantry a <em>country</em> to fight for.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Harrison Blake, September 26, 1855</p>

<p>It is well to find your employment and amusement in simple and homely things. These wear best and yield most. I think I would rather watch the motions of these cows in their pasture for a day, which I now see all headed one way and slowly advancing &mdash; watch them and project their course carefully on a chart, and report all their behavior faithfully &mdash; than wander to Europe or Asia and watch other motions there; for it is only ourselves that we report in either case, and perchance we shall report a more restless and worthless self in the latter case than in the first.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, October 5, 1856</p>

<p>When La Mountain and Haddock dropped down in the Canada wilderness the other day, they came near starving, or dying of cold and wet and fatigure, not knowing where to look for food or how to shelter themselves. Thus far we have wandered from a simple and independent life. I think that a wise and independent, self-reliant man will have a complete list of the edibles to be found in a primitive country or wilderness, a bill of fare, in his waistcoat pocket at least, to say nothing of matches and warm clothing, so that he can commence a systematic search for them without loss of time.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, October 17, 1858</p>

<p>Yesterday, toward night, gave Sophia and mother a sail as far as the Battle-Ground. One-eyed John Goodwin, the fisherman, was loading into a hand-cart and conveying home the piles of driftwood which of late he had collected with his boat. It was a beautiful evening, and a clear amber sunset lit up all the eastern shores; and that man’s employment, so simple and direct &mdash; though he is regarded by most as a vicious character &mdash; whose whole motive was so easy to fathom &mdash; thus to obtain his winter’s wood &mdash; charmed me unspeakably. So much do we love actions that are simple. They are all poetic. We, too, would fain be so employed. So unlike the pursuits of most men, so artificial or complicated. Consider how the broker collects his winter’s wood, what sport he makes of it, what is his boat and hand-cart! Postponing instant life, he makes haste to Boston in the cars, and there deals in stocks, not quite relishing his employment &mdash; and so earns the money with which he buys his fuel. And when, by chance, I meet him about this indirect and complicated business, I am not struck with the beauty of his employment. It does not harmonize with the sunset. How much more the former consults his genius, some genius at any rate! Now I should love to get my fuel so &mdash; I have got some so &mdash; but though I may be glad to have it, I do not love to get it in any other way less simple and direct. For if I buy one necessary of life, I cheat myself to some extent, I deprive myself of the pleasure, the inexpressible joy, which is the unfailing reward of satisfying any want of our nature simply and truly.</p>
<p>No <em>trade</em> is simple, but artificial and complex. It postpones life and substitutes death. It goes against the grain. If the first generation does not die of it, the third or fourth does.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, October 22, 1853</p>

<p>I think that men generally are mistaken with regard to amusements. Every one who deserves to be regarded as higher than the brute may be supposed to have an earnest purpose, to accomplish which is the object of his existence, and this is at once his work and his supremest pleasure; and for diversion and relaxation, for suggestion and education and strength, there is offered the never-failing amusement of getting a living &mdash; never-failing, I mean, when temperately indulged in. I know of no such amusement &mdash; so wholesome and in every sense profitable &mdash; for instance, as to spend an hour or two in a day picking some berries or other fruits which will be food for the winter, or collecting driftwood from the river for fuel, or cultivating the few beans and potatoes which I want. Theatres and operas, which intoxicate for a season, are as nothing compared to these pursuits. And so it is with all the true arts of life. Farming and building and manufacturing and sailing are the greatest and wholesomest amusements that were ever invented (for God invented them), and I suppose that the farmers and mechanics know it, only I think they indulge to excess generally, and so what was meant for a joy becomes the sweat of the brow. Gambling, horse-racing, loafing, and rowdyism generally, after all tempt but few. The mass are tempted by those other amusements, of farming, etc. It is a great amusement, and more profitable than I could have invented, to go and spend an afternoon hour picking cranberries. By these various pursuits your experience becomes singularly complete and rounded. The novelty and significance of such pursuits are remarkable. Such is the path by which we climb to the heights of our being; and compare the poetry which such simple pursuits have inspired with the unreadable volumes which have been written about art.</p>
<p>Who is the most profitable companion? He who has been picking cranberries and chopping wood, or he has been attending the opera all his days? I find when I have been building a fence or surveying a farm, or even collecting simples, that these were the true paths to perception and enjoyment. My being seems to have put forth new roots and to be more strongly planted. This is the true way to crack the nut of happiness. If, as a poet or naturalist, you wish to explore a given neighborhood, go and live in it, i.e., get your living in it. Fish in its streams, hunt in its forests, gather fuel from its water, its woods, cultivate the ground, and pluck the wild fruits, etc., etc. This will be the surest and speediest way to those perceptions you covet. No amusement has worn better than farming. It tempts men just as strongly today as in the day of Cincinnatus. Healthily and properly pursued, it is not a whit more grave than huckleberrying, and if it takes any airs on itself as superior then there's something wrong about it.</p>
<p>I have aspired to practice in succession all the honest arts of life, that I may gather all their fruits. But then, if you are intemperate, if you toil to raise an unnecessary amount of corn, even the large crop of wheat becomes as a small crop of chaff.</p>
<p>If our living were once honestly got, then it would be time to invent other amusements.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, October 29, 1857</p>

<p>I hate the present modes of living and getting a living. Farming and shopkeeping and working at a trade or profession are all odious to me. I should relish getting my living in a simple, primitive fashion. The life which society proposes to me to live is so artificial and complex &mdash; bolstered up on many weak supports, and sure to topple down at last &mdash; that no man surely can ever be inspired to live it, and only "old fogies" ever praise it. At best some think it their duty to live it. I believe in the infinite joy and satisfaction of helping myself to the extent of my ability. But what is the use in trying to live simply, raising what you eat, burning what you cut or dig, when those to whom you are allied insanely want and will have a thousand other things which neither you nor they can raise and nobody else, perchance, will pay for? The fellow-man to whom you are yoked is a steer that is ever bolting right the other way.</p>

<p>The pleasure, the warmth, is not so much in <em>having</em> as in a true and simple manner <em>getting</em> these necessaries.</p>
<p>Men prefer foolishly the gold to that of which it is the symbol &mdash; simple, honest, independent labor. Can gold be said to buy food, if it does not buy an appetite for food? It is fouler and uglier to have too much than not to have enough.</p>

<p>If I would preserve my relation to nature, I must make my life more moral, more pure and innocent. The problem is as precise and simple as a mathematical one. I must not live loosely, but more and more continently.</p>

<p>That grand old poem called Winter is round again without any connivance of mine. As I sit under Lee's Cliff, where the snow is melted, amid sere pennyroyal and frost-bitten catnep, I look over my shoulder upon an arctic scene. I see with surprise the pond a dumb white surface of ice speckled with snow, just as so many winters before, where so lately were lapsing waves or smooth reflecting water. I see the holes which the pickerel-fisher has made, and I see him, too, retreating over the hills, drawing his sled behind him. The water is already skimmed over again there. I hear, too, the familiar belching voice of the pond. It seemed as if winter had come without any interval since midsummer, and I was prepared to see it flit away by the time I again looked over my shoulder. It was as if I had dreamed it. But I see that the farmers have had time to gather their harvests as usual, and the seasons have revolved as slowly as in the first autumn of my life. The winters come now as fast as snowflakes. It is wonderful that old men do not lose their reckoning. It was summer, and now again it is winter. Nature loves this rhyme so well that she never tires of repeating it. So sweet and wholesom is the winter, so simple and moderate, so satisfactory and perfect, that her children will never weary of it. What a poem! an epic in blank verse, enriched with a million tinkling rhymes. It is solid beauty. It has been subjected to the vicissitudes of millions of years of the gods, and not a single superfluous ornament remains. The severest and coldest of the immortal critics have shot their arrows at and pruned it till it cannot be amended.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, December 7, 1856</p>

<p>What mountain are you camping on nowadays? Though I had a good time at the mountains, I confess that the journey did not bear any fruit that I know of. I did not expect it would. The mode of it was not simple and adventurous enough. You must first have made an infinite demand, and not unreasonably, but after a corresponding outlay, have an all-absorbing purpose, and at the same time that your feet bear you hither and thither, travel much more in imagination.</p>
<p>To let the mountains slide &mdash; live at home like a traveller. It should not be in vain that these things are shown us from day to day. Is not each withered leaf that I see in my walks something which I have travelled to find?&mdash;travelled, who can tell how far? What a fool he must be who thinks that his El Dorado is anywhere but where he lives!</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Harrison Blake, January 1, 1859</p>

<p>Though winter is represented in the almanac as an old man, facing the wind and sleet, and drawing his cloak about him, we rather think of him as a merry woodchopper, and warm-blooded youth, as blithe as summer. The unexplored grandeur of the storm keeps up the spirits of the traveller. It does not trifle with us, but has a sweet earnestness. In winter we lead a more inward life. Our hearts are warm and cheery, like cottages under drifts, whose windows and doors are half concealed, but from whose chimneys the smoke cheerfully ascends. The imprisoning drifts increase the sense of comfort which the house affords, and in the coldest days we are content to sit over the hearth and see the sky through the chimney-top, enjoying the quiet and serene life that may be had in a warm corner by the chimney-side, or feeling our pulse by listening to the low of cattle in the street, or the sound of the flail in distant barns all the long afternoon. No doubt a skillful physician could determine our health by observing how these simple and natural sounds affected us. We enjoy now, not an Oriental, but a Boreal leisure, around warm stoves and fireplaces, and watch the shadow of motes in the sunbeams.</p>
<p>&mdash;"A Winter's Walk" (1843)</p>

<p>What of architectural beauty I now see, I know has gradually grown from within outward, out of the character and necessities of the indweller and builder, without even a thought for mere ornament, but an unconscious nobleness and truthfulness of character and life; and whatever additional beauty of this kind id destined to be produced will be preceded and accompanied, aye, created, by a like unconscious beauty of life. One of the most beautiful buildings in this country is a logger's hut in the woods, and equally beautiful will be the citizen's suburban box, when the life of the indweller shall be as simple and agreeable to the imagination, and there is as little straining after effect in the style of his dwelling.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, January 11, 1852</p>

<p>The question is not where did the traveller go? what places did he see? &mdash; it would be difficult to choose between places &mdash; but who was the traveller? how did he travel? how genuine an experience did he get? For travelling is, in the main, like as if you stayed at home, and then the question is how do you live and conduct yourself at home? What I mean is that it might be hard to decide whether I would travel to Lake Superior, or Labrador, or Florida. Perhaps none would be worth the while, if I went by the usual mode. But if I travel in a simple, primitive, original manner, standing in a truer relation to men and nature, travel away from the old and commonplace, get some honest experience of life, if only out of my feet and homesickness, then it becomes less important whither I go or how far. I so see the world from a new and more commanding point of view.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, January 11, 1852</p>

<p>Then to my morning work. First I take an axe and pail and go in search of water, if that be not a dream. After a cold and snowy night it needed a divining-rod to find it. Every winter the liquid and trembling surface of the pond, which was so sensitive to every breath, and reflected every light and shadow, becomes solid to the depth of a foot or a foot and a half, so that it will support the heaviest teams, and perchance the snow covers it to an equal depth, and it is not to be distinguished from any level field. Like the marmots in the surrounding hills, it closes its eyelids and becomes dormant for three months or more. Standing on the snow-covered plain, as if in a pasture amid the hills, I cut my way first through a foot of snow, and then a foot of ice, and open a window under my feet, where, kneeling to drink, I look down into the quiet parlor of the fishes, pervaded by a softened light as through a window of ground glass, with its bright sanded floor the same as in summer; there a perennial waveless serenity reigns as in the amber twilight sky, corresponding to the cool and even temperament of the inhabitants.  Heaven is under our feet is well as over our heads.</p>
<p>&mdash;Walden, "The Pond in Winter"</p>

<p>The wonderful purity of nature at this season is a most pleasing fact. Every decayed stump and moss-grown stone and rail, and the dead leaves of autumn, are concealed by a clean napkin of snow. In the bare fields and tinkling woods, see what virtue survives. In the coldest and bleakest places, the warmest charities still maintain a foothold. A cold and searching wind drives away all contagion, and nothing can withstand it but what has a virtue in it, and accordingly, whatever we meet with in cold and bleak places, as the tops of mountains, we respect for a sort of sturdy innocence, a Puritan toughness. All things beside seem to be called in for shelter, and what stays out must be part of the original frame of the universe, and of such valor as God himself. It is invigorating to breathe the cleansed air.  Its greater fineness and purity are visible to the eye, and we would fain stay out long and late, that the gales may sigh through us, too, as through the leafless trees, and fit us for the winter,&mdash;as if we hoped so to borrow some pure and steadfast virtue, which will stead us in all seasons.</p>

<p>March fans it, April christens it, and May puts on its jacket and trousers. It never grows up, but Alexandrian-like "drags its slow length along," ever springing, bud following close upon leaf, and when winter comes it is not annihilated, but creeps on mole-like under the snow, showing its face nevertheless occasionally by fuming springs and watercourses. So let it be with man &mdash; let his manhood be a more advanced and still advancing youth, bud following hard upon leaf. (Journal, March 1, 1838)</p>

<p>We too have our thaws. They come of our January moods, when our ice cracks, and our sluices break loose. Thought that was frozen up under stern experience gushes forth in feeling and expression. There is a freshet which carries away dams of accumulated ice. Our thoughts hide unexpressed, like the buds under their downy or resinous scales; they would hardly keep a partridge from starving.  —Journal, January 31, 1854</p>

<p>In the crimson colors of the west I discern the budding hues of dawn. To my western brother it is rising pure and bright as it did to me, but the evening exhibits in the still rear of the day the beauty which through morning and noon escaped me. (Journal, July 3, 1840)</p>

<p>I have no more distinctness or pointedness in my yearnings than an expanding bud, which does indeed point to flower and fruit, to summer and autumn, but is aware of the warm sun and spring influence only. I feel ripe for something, yet do nothing, can't discover what that thing is. I feel fertile merely. It is seedtime with me. I have lain fallow long enough. (Journal, November 17, 1850)</p>

<p>Pulling up the johnswort on the face of the Cliff, I am surprised to see the signs of unceasing growth about the roots &mdash; fresh shoots two inches long, white with red leaflets, and all the radical part quite green. The leaves of the crowfoot, also, are quite green, and carry me forward to spring. I dig one up with a stick, and, pulling it to pieces, I find deep in the centre of the plant, just beneath the ground, surrounded by all the tender leaves that are about to precede it, the blossom-bud, about half as big as the head of a pin, perfectly white. There it patiently sits, or slumbers, how full of faith, informed of a spring which the world has never seen, the promise and prophecy of it shaped somewhat like some Eastern temples, in which a bud-shaped dome o'ertops the whole. It affected me, this tender dome-like bud, within the bosom of the earth, like a temple upon the earth, resounding with the worship of votaries. Methought I saw the flamens in yellow robes within it. The crowfoot buds &mdash; and how many beside! &mdash; lie unexpanded just beneath the surface. May I lead my life the following year as innocently as they! May it be as fair and smell as sweet! I anticipate nature. (Journal, January 9, 1853)</p>

<p>Our work should be fitted to and lead on the time, as bud, flower, and fruit lead the circle of the seasons. (Journal, February 17, 1841)</p>

<p>Evidently some buds are further advanced than others even when the winter comes, and then these are further expanded and matured in advance of the others in the very warm days in the winter.</p>

<p>Methinks roses oftenest display their high colors, colors which invariably attract all eyes and betray them, against a dark ground, as the dark green or the shady recesses of the bushes and copses, where they show to best advantage. Their enemies do not spare the open flower for an hour. Hence, if for no other reason, their buds are most beautiful. Their promise of perfect and dazzling beauty, when their buds are just beginning to expand &mdash; beauty which they can hardly contain &mdash; as in most youths, commonly surpasses their expanded flowers.</p>

<p>I see in the swamp under the Cliffs the dark, decaying leaves of the skunk-cabbage, four or five spreading every way and so flat and decated as to look like a fungus or mildew, making it doubtful at first what plant it is; but there is the sharp green bud already revealed in the centre between the leaf-stalks, ready to expand in the spring.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, September 14, 1859</p>

<p>The leaves of the azaleas are falling, mostly fallen, and revealing the large blossom-buds, so prepared are they for another year. With man all is uncertainty. He does not confidently look forward to another spring. But examine the root of the savory-leaved aster, and you will find the new shoots, fair purple shoots, which are to curve upward and bear the next year's flowers, already grown half an inch or more in length. Nature is confident.</p>

<p>The swamp amelanchier is leafing again, as usual. What a pleasing phenomenon, perhaps an Indian-summer growth, an anticipation of the spring, like the notes of birds and frogs, etc., an evidence of warmth and genialness. Its buds are annually awakened by the October sun as if it were spring. The shad-bush is leafing again by the sunny swamp-side. It is like a youthful or poetic thought in old age. Several times I have been cheered by this sight when surveying in former years. The chickadee seems to lisp a sweeter note at the sight of it. I would not fear the winter more than the shad-bush which puts forth fresh and tender leaves on its approach. In the fall I will take this for my coat-of-arms. It seems to detain the sun that expands it. These twigs are so full of life that they can hardly contain themselves. They ignore winter. They anticipate spring. What faith! Away in some warm and sheltered recess in the swamp you find where these leaves have expanded. It is a foretaste of spring. In my latter years, let me have some <em>shad-bush</em> thoughts.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, October 13, 1859</p>

<p>Now that the leaves are fallen (for a few days), the long yellow buds (often red-pointed) which sleep along the twigs of the <em>S. discolor</em> are very conspicuous and quite interesting, already even carrying our thoughts forward to spring. I noticed them first on the 22nd. They may be put with the azalea buds already noticed. Even bleak and barren November wears these gems on her breast in sign of the coming year. How many thoughts lie undeveloped, as it were dormant, like these buds, in the minds of men!</p>
<p>This is the coolest day thus far, reminded me that I have only a half-thick coat on. The easterly wind comes cold into my ear, as yet unused to it. Yet this first decided coolness &mdash; not to say wintriness &mdash; is not only bracing but exhilirating and concentrating our forces. So much the more I have a hearth and heart <em>within</em> me. We step more briskly, and brace ourselves against the winter.</p>

<p>If you are afflicted with melancholy at this season, go to the swamp and see the brave spears of skunk-cabbage buds already advanced toward a new year. Their gravestones are not bespoken yet. Who shall be sexton to them? Is it the winter of their discontent? Do they seem to have lain down to die, despairing of skunk-cabbagedom? "Up and at 'em," "Give it to 'em,", "Excelsior," "Put it through," &mdash; these are their mottoes. Mortal human creatures must take a little respite in this fall of the year; their spirits do flag a little. There is a little questioning of destiny, and thinking to go like cowards to where the "weary shall be at rest." But not so with the skunk-cabbage. Its withered leaves are transfixed by a rising bud. Winter and death are ignored; the circle of life is complete. Are these false prophets? Is it a lie or a vain boast underneath the skunk-cabbage bud, pushing it upward and lifting the dead leaves with it? They rest with spears advanced; they rest to shoot!</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, October 31, 1857</p>

<p>I wandered over bare fields where the cattle, lately turned out, roamed restless and unsatisfied with the feed; I dived into a rustling young oak wood where not a green leaf was to be seen; I climbed to the geological axis of elevation and clambered over curly-pated rocks whose strata are on their edges amid the rising woods; and again I thought, They are all gone surely and left me alone. Not a man Friday remains. What nutriment can I extract from these bare twigs? Starvation stares me in the face. "Nay, Nay!" said a nuthatch, making its way, head downward, about a bare hickory close by. "The nearer the bone, the sweeter the meat. Only the superfluous has been swept away. Now we behold the naked truth. If at any time the weather is too cold and bleak for you, keep the sunny side of the trunk, for there is a wholesome and spring warmth such as the summer never afforded. There are the winter mornings with the sun on the oak wood tops. While buds sleep, thoughts wake." ("Hear! Hear!" screamed the jay from a neighboring copse, where I heard a twittering for some time.) "Winter has a concentrated and nutty kernel, if you know where to look for it."</p>

<p>The first sparrow of spring! The year beginning with younger hope than ever! The faint silvery warblings heard over the partially bare and moist fields from the bluebird, the song sparrow, and the red-wing, as if the last flakes of winter tinkled as they fell! What at such a time are histories, chronologies, traditions, and all written revelations?  The brooks sing carols and glees to the spring. The marsh hawk, sailing low over the meadow, is already seeking the first slimy life that awakes. The sinking sound of melting snow is heard in all dells, and the ice dissolves apace in the ponds. The grass flames up on the hillsides like a spring fire &#151; "et primitus oritur herba imbribus primoribus evocata" &#151; as if the earth sent forth an inward heat to greet the returning sun; not yellow but green is the color of its flame; &#151; the symbol of perpetual youth, the grass-blade, like a long green ribbon, streams from the sod into the summer, checked indeed by the frost, but anon pushing on again, lifting its spear of last year's hay with the fresh life below. It grows as steadily as the rill oozes out of the ground. It is almost identical with that, for in the growing days of June, when the rills are dry, the grass-blades are their channels, and from year to year the herds drink at this perennial green stream, and the mower draws from it betimes their winter supply. So our human life but dies down to its root, and still puts forth its green blade to eternity.</p>
<p>&mdash;Walden, "Spring"</p>

<p>At length the winter set in good earnest, just as I had finished plastering, and the wind began to howl around the house as if it had not had permission to do so till then. Night after night the geese came lumbering in the dark with a clangor and a whistling of wings, even after the ground was covered with snow, some to alight in Walden, and some flying low over the woods toward Fair Haven, bound for Mexico.  Several times, when returning from the village at ten or eleven o'clock at night, I heard the tread of a flock of geese, or else ducks, on the dry leaves in the woods by a pond-hole behind my dwelling, where they had come up to feed, and the faint honk or quack of their leader as they hurried off. In 1845 Walden froze entirely over for the first time on the night of the 22d of December, Flint's and other shallower ponds and the river having been frozen ten days or more; in '46, the 16th; in '49, about the 31st; and in '50, about the 27th of December; in '52, the 5th of January; in '53, the 31st of December. The snow had already covered the ground since the 25th of November, and surrounded me suddenly with the scenery of winter. I withdrew yet farther into my shell, and endeavored to keep a bright fire both within my house and within my breast. My employment out of doors now was to collect the dead wood in the forest, bringing it in my hands or on my shoulders, or sometimes trailing a dead pine tree under each arm to my shed. An old forest fence which had seen its best days was a great haul for me. I sacrificed it to Vulcan, for it was past serving the god Terminus. How much more interesting an event is that man's supper who has just been forth in the snow to hunt, nay, you might say, steal, the fuel to cook it with! His bread and meat are sweet. There are enough fagots and waste wood of all kinds in the forests of most of our towns to support many fires, but which at present warm none, and, some think, hinder the growth of the young wood. There was also the driftwood of the pond. In the course of the summer I had discovered a raft of pitch pine logs with the bark on, pinned together by the Irish when the railroad was built. This I hauled up partly on the shore. After soaking two years and then lying high six months it was perfectly sound, though waterlogged past drying. I amused myself one winter day with sliding this piecemeal across the pond, nearly half a mile, skating behind with one end of a log fifteen feet long on my shoulder, and the other on the ice; or I tied several logs together with a birch withe, and then, with a longer birch or alder which had a book at the end, dragged them across. Though completely waterlogged and almost as heavy as lead, they not only burned long, but made a very hot fire; nay, I thought that they burned better for the soaking, as if the pitch, being confined by the water, burned longer, as in a lamp.</p>
<p>&mdash;Walden, "House Warming"</p>

<p>What more glorious condition of being can we imagine than from impure to be becoming pure? It is almost desirable to be impure that we may be the subject of this improvement. That I am innocent to myself! That I love and reverence my life! That I am better fitted for a lofty society today than I was yesterday! To make my life a sacrament! What is nature without this lofty tumbling? May I treat myself with more and more respect and tenderness. May I not forget that I am impure and vicious. May I not cease to love purity. May I go to my slumbers as expecting to arise to a new and more perfect day. May I so live and refine my life as fitting myself for a society ever higher than I actually enjoy. May I treat myself tenderly as I would treat the most innocent child whom I love; may I treat children and my friends as my newly discovered self. Let me forever go in search of myself; never for a moment think that I have found myself; be as a stranger to myself, never a familiar, seeking acquaintance still. May I be to myself as one is to me whom I love, a dear and cherished object. What temple, what fane, what sacred place can there be but the innermost part of my own being? The possibility of my own improvement, that is to be cherished. As I regard myself, so I am. O my dear friends, I have not forgotten you. I will know you tomorrow. I associate you with my ideal self. I had ceased to have faith in myself. I thought I was grown up and become what I was intended to be, but it is earliest spring with me. In relation to virtue and innocence the oldest man is in the beginning spring and vernal season of life. It is the love of virtue makes us young ever. That is the fountain of youth, the very aspiration after the perfect. I love and worship myself with a love which absorbs my love for the world. The lecturer suggested to me that I might become better than I am. Was it not a good lecture then? May I dream not that I shunned vice; may I dream that I loved and practiced virtue.</p>

<p>How watchful we must be to keep the crystal well that we were made, clear! that it be not made turbid by our contact with the world, so that it wil not reflect objects. What other liberty is there worth having, if we have not freedom and peace in our minds &mdash; if our inmost and most private man is but a sour and turbid pool? Often we are so jarred by chagrins in dealing with the world, that we cannot reflect. Everything beautiful impresses us as sufficient to itself. Many men who have had much intercourse with the world and not borne the trial well affect me as all resistance, all bur and rind, without any gentleman, or tender and innocent core left. They have become hedgehogs.</p>
<p>Ah! the world is too much with us, and our whole soul is stained by what it works in, like the dyer's hand. A man had better starve at once than lose his innocence in the process of getting his bread. This is the pool of Bethsaida which must be stilled and become smooth before we can enter to be healed. If within the old man there is not a young man &mdash; within the sophisticated, one unsophisticated &mdash; then he is but one of the devil's angels.</p>
<p>It is surprising how any reminiscence of a different season of the year affects us. When I meet with any such in my Journal, it affects me as poetry, and I appreciate that other season and that particular phenomenon more than at any time. The world so seen is all one spring, full of beauty. You only need to make a faithful record of an average summer's day experience and summer mood, and read it in the winter, and it will carry you back to more than that summer day alone could show. Only the rarest flower, the purest melody, of the season thus comes down to us.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, October 26, 1853</p>

<p>The wonderful purity of nature at this season is a most pleasing fact. Every decayed stump and moss-grown stone and rail, and the dead leaves of autumn, are concealed by a clean napkin of snow. In the bare fields and tinkling woods, see what virtue survives. In the coldest and bleakest places, the warmest charities still maintain a foothold. A cold and searching wind drives away all contagion, and nothing can withstand it but what has a virtue in it, and accordingly, whatever we meet with in cold and bleak places, as the tops of mountains, we respect for a sort of sturdy innocence, a Puritan toughness. All things beside seem to be called in for shelter, and what stays out must be part of the original frame of the universe, and of such valor as God himself. It is invigorating to breathe the cleansed air. Its greater fineness and purity are visible to the eye, and we would fain stay out long and late, that the gales may sigh through us, too, as through the leafless trees, and fit us for the winter &mdash; as if we hoped so to borrow some pure and steadfast virtue, which will stead us in all seasons.</p>
<p>There is a slumbering subterranean fire in nature which never goes out, and which no cold can chill. It finally melts the great snow, and in January or July is only buried under a thicker or thinner covering. In the coldest day it flows somewhere, and the snow melts around every tree. This field of winter rye, which sprouted late in the fall, and now speedily dissolves the snow, is where the fire is very thinly covered. We feel warmed by it. In the winter, warmth stands for all virtue, and we resort in thought to a trickling rill, with its bare stones shining in the sun, and to warm springs in the woods, with as much eagerness as rabbits and robins. The steam which rises from swamps and pools is as dear and domestic as that of our own kettle. What fire could ever equal the sunshine of a winter's day, when the meadow mice come out by the wall-sides, and the chickadee lisps in the defiles of the wood? The warmth comes directly from the sun, and is not radiated from the earth, as in summer; and when we feel his beams on our backs as we are treading some snowy dell, we are grateful as for a special kindness, and bless the sun which has followed us into that by-place.</p>
<p>This subterranean fire has its altar in each man's breast; for in the coldest day, and on the bleakest hill, the traveller cherishes a warmer fire within the folds of his cloak than is kindled on any hearth. A healthy man, indeed, is the complement of the seasons, and in winter, summer is in his heart. There is the south. Thither have all birds and insects migrated, and around the warm springs in his breast are gathered the robin and the lark.</p> 
<p>&mdash;"A Winter's Walk" (1843)</p>

<p>All things in this world must be seen with the morning dew on them, must be seen with youthful, early-opened, hopeful eyes.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, June 13, 1852</p>

<p>The youth gets together his materials to build a bridge to the moon, or perchance a palace or a temple on the earth, and at length the middle-aged man concludes to build a wood-shed with them.</p>
<p>Trees have commonly two growths in a year, a spring and a fall growth, and you can see where the first was checked whether by cold or drouth, and wonder what there was in the summer to produce this check, this blight. So it is with man; most have a spring growth only, and never get over this first check to their youthful hopes; but plants of hardier constitution, or perchance planted in a more genial soil, speedily recover themselves, and, though they bear the scar or knot in remembrance of their disappointment, they push forward again and have a vigorous fall growth which is equivalent to a new spring.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, July 14, 1852</p>

<p>We are wont to forget that the sun looks on our cultivated fields and on the prairies and forests without distinction. They all reflect and absorb his rays alike, and the former make but a small part of the glorious picture which he beholds in his daily course. In his view the earth is all equally cultivated like a garden. Therefore we should receive the benefit of his light and heat with a corresponding trust and magnanimity. What though I value the seed of these beans, and harvest that in the fall of the year? This broad field which I have looked at so long looks not to me as the principal cultivator, but away from me to influences more genial to it, which water and make it green. These beans have results which are not harvested by me. Do they not grow for woodchucks partly? The ear of wheat (in Latin spica, obsoletely speca, from spe, hope) should not be the only hope of the husbandman; its kernel or grain (granum from gerendo, bearing) is not all that it bears. How, then, can our harvest fail? Shall I not rejoice also at the abundance of the weeds whose seeds are the granary of the birds? It matters little comparatively whether the fields fill the farmer's barns. The true husbandman will cease from anxiety, as the squirrels manifest no concern whether the woods will bear chestnuts this year or not, and finish his labor with every day, relinquishing all claim to the produce of his fields, and sacrificing in his mind not only his first but his last fruits also.</p>
<p>&mdash;Walden, "The Bean-Field"</p>

<p>As in geology, so in social institutions, we may discover the causes of all past change in the present invariable order of society. The greatest appreciable physical revolutions are the work of the light-footed air, the stealthy-paced water, and the subterranean fire. Aristotle said, "As time never fails, and the universe is eternal, neither the Tanais nor the Nile can have flowed forever." We are independent of the change we detect. The longer the lever the less perceptible its motion. It is the slowest pulsation which is the most vital. The hero then will know how to wait, as well as to make haste. All good abides with him who waiteth <em>wisely</em>; we shall sooner overtake the dawn by remaining here than by hurrying over the hills of the west. Be assured that every man's success is in proportion to his <em>average</em> ability. The meadow flowers spring and bloom where the waters annually deposit their slime, not where they reach in some freshet only. A man is not his hope, nor his despair, nor yet his past deed. We know not yet what we have done, still less what we are doing. Wait till evening, and other parts of our day's work will shine than we had thought at noon, and we shall discover the real purport of our toil. As when the farmer has reached the end of the furrow and looks back, he can tell best where the pressed earth shines most.</p>
<p>&mdash;A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, "Monday"</p>

<p>We love not so well the landscape represented as in broad noon, but in a morning or evening twilight, those seasons when the imagination is most active, the more hopeful or pensive seasons of the day. Our mood may then possess the whole landscape, or be in harmony with it, as the hue of twilight prevails over the whole scene. Are we more than crepuscular in our intellectual and spiritual life? Have we awakened to broad noon? The morning hope is soon lost in what becomes the routine of the day, and we do not recover ourselves again until we land on the pensive shores of evening, shores which skirt the great western continent of the night. At sunset we look into the west. For centuries our thoughts fish those grand banks that lie before the newfoundland, before our spirits take up their abode in that Hesperian Continent to which these lie in the way.</p>

</ul>

<p>Some absorbing employment on your higher ground &mdash; your upland farm &mdash; whither no cart-path leads, but where you mount alone with your hoe &mdash; where the life everlasting grows; there you raise a crop which needs not to be brought down into the valley to a market; which you barter for heavenly products.</p>
<p>Do you separate distinctly enough the support of your body from that of your essence? By how distinct a course commonly are these two ends attained! Not that they should not be attained by one and the same means &mdash; that, indeed, is the rarest success &mdash; but there is no half and half about it.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Harrison Blake, May 28, 1850</p>

<p>There is thus about all natural products a certain volatile and ethereal quality which represents their highest value, and which cannot be vulgarized, or bought and sold. No mortal has ever enjoyed the perfect flavor of any fruit, and only the godlike among men begin to taste its ambrosial qualities. For nectar and ambrosia are only those fine flavors of every earthly fruit which our coarse palates fail to perceive, just as we occupy the heaven of the gods without knowing it. When I see a particularly mean man carrying a load of fair and fragrant early apples to market, I seem to see a contest going on between him and his horse, on the one side, and the apples on the other, and, to my mind, the apples always gain it. Pliny says that apples are the heaviest of all things, and that the oxen begin to sweat at the mere sight of a load of them. Our driver begins to lose his load the moment he tries to transport them to where they do not belong, that is, to any but the most beautiful. Though he gets out from time to time, and feels of them, and thinks they are all there, I see the stream of their evanescent and celestial qualities going to heaven from his cart, while the pulp and skin and core only are going to market. They are not apples, but pomace. Are not these still Iduna's apples, the taste of which keeps the gods forever young? and think you that they will let Loki or Thjassi carry them off to Jotunheim, while they grow wrinkled and gray? No, for Ragnarok, or the destruction of the gods, is not yet.</p>
<p>&mdash;"Wild Apples"</p>

<p>Sometimes, having had a surfeit of human society and gossip, and worn out all my village friends, I rambled still farther westward than I habitually dwell, into yet more unfrequented parts of the town, "to fresh woods and pastures new," or, while the sun was setting, made my supper of huckleberries and blueberries on Fair Haven Hill, and laid up a store for several days. The fruits do not yield their true flavor to the purchaser of them, nor to him who raises them for the market. There is but one way to obtain it, yet few take that way. If you would know the flavor of huckleberries, ask the cowboy or the partridge. It is a vulgar error to suppose that you have tasted huckleberries who never plucked them. A huckleberry never reaches Boston; they have not been known there since they grew on her three hills. The ambrosial and essential part of the fruit is lost with the bloom which is rubbed off in the market cart, and they become mere provender. As long as Eternal Justice reigns, not one innocent huckleberry can be transported thither from the country's hills.</p>
<p>&mdash;Walden, "The Ponds"</p>

<p>White Pond and Walden are great crystals on the surface of the earth, Lakes of Light. If they were permanently congealed, and small enough to be clutched, they would, perchance, be carried off by slaves, like precious stones, to adorn the heads of emperors; but being liquid, and ample, and secured to us and our successors forever, we disregard them, and run after the diamond of Kohinoor. They are too pure to have a market value; they contain no muck. How much more beautiful than our lives, how much more transparent than our characters, are they! We never learned meanness of them. How much fairer than the pool before the farmer's door, in which his ducks swim! Hither the clean wild ducks come. Nature has no human inhabitant who appreciates her. The birds with their plumage and their notes are in harmony with the flowers, but what youth or maiden conspires with the wild luxuriant beauty of Nature? She flourishes most alone, far from the towns where they reside. Talk of heaven! ye disgrace earth.</p>
<p>&mdash;Walden, "The Ponds"</p>

<p>The value of these wild fruits is not in the mere possession or eating of them, but in the sight or enjoyment of them. The very derivation of the word “fruit” would suggest this. It is from the Latin <em>fructus</em>, meaning that which is <em>used</em> or <em>enjoyed</em>. If it were not so, then going a-berrying and going to market would be nearly synonymous expressions. Of course it is the spirit in which you do a thing which makes it interesting, whether it is sweeping a room or pulling turnips. Peaches are unquestionably a very beautiful and palatable fruit, but the gathering of them for the market is not nearly so interesting as the gathering of huckleberries for your own use.</p>
<p>A man fits out a ship at a great expense and sends it to the West Indies with a crew of men and boys, and after six months or a year it comes back with a load of pineapples. Now, if no more gets accomplished than the speculator commonly aims at &mdash; if it simply turns out what is called a successful venture &mdash; I am less interested in this expedition than in some child’s first excursion a-huckleberrying, in which it is introduced into a new world, experiences a new development, though it brings home only a gill of huckleberries in its basket. I know that the newspapers and the politicians declare otherwise, but they do not alter the fact. Then, I think that the fruit of the latter expedition was finer than that of the former. It was a more fruitful expedition. The value of any experience is measured, of course, not by the amount of money, but the amount of development we get out of it. If a New England boy’s dealings with oranges and pineapples have had more to do with his development than picking huckleberries or pulling turnips have, then he rightly and naturally thinks more of the former; otherwise not.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, November 26, 1860</p>

<p>The richest gifts we can bestow are the least marketable. We hate the kindness which we understand. A noble person confers no such gift as his whole confidence: none so exalts the giver and the receiver; it produces the truest gratitude. Perhaps it is only essential to friendship that some vital trust should have been reposed by the one in the other. I feel addressed and probed even to the remote parts of my being when one nobly shows, even in trivial things, an implicit faith in me. When such divine commodities are so near and cheap, how strange that it should have to be each day's discovery! A threat or a curse may be forgotten, but this mild trust translates me. I am no more of this earth; it acts dynamically; it changes my very substance. I cannot do what before I did. I cannot be what before I was. Other chains may be broken, but in the darkest night, in the remotest place, I trail this thread. Then things cannot <em>happen</em>. What if God were to confide in us for a moment! Should we not then be gods?</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Ralph Waldo Emerson, February 12, 1843</p>

<p>Methinks my present experience is nothing; my past experience is all in all. I think that no experience which I have today comes up to, or is comparable with, the experiences of my boyhood. And not only this is true, but as far back as I can remember I have unconsciously referred to the experiences of a previous state of existence. "For life is a forgetting," etc. Formerly, methought, nature developed as I developed, and grew up with me. My life was ecstasy. In youth, before I lost any of my senses, I can remember that I was all alive, and inhabited my body with inexpressible satisfaction; both its weariness and its refreshment were sweet to me. This earth was the most glorious musical instrument, and I was audience to its strains. To have such sweet impressions made on us, such ecstasies begotten of the breezes! I can remember how I was astonished. I said to myself &mdash; I said to others &mdash; "There comes into my mind such an indescribable, infinite, all-absorbing, divine, heavenly pleasure, a sense of elevation and expansion, and I have had nought to do with it. I perceive that I am dealt with by superior powers. This is a pleasure, a joy, an existence which I have not procured myself. I speak as a witness on the stand and tell what I have perceived." The morning and the evening were sweet to me, and I led a life aloof from society of men. I wondered if a mortal had ever known what I knew. I looked in books for some recognition of a kindred experience — but strange to say, I found none. Indeed I was slow to discover that other men had had this experience — for it had been possible to read books and to associate with men on other grounds. The maker of me was improving me. When I detected this interference I was profoundly moved. For years I marched as to a music in comparison with which the military music of the streets is noise and discord. I was daily intoxicated, and yet no man would call me intemperate. With all your science can you tell how it is, and whence it is, that light comes into the soul?</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, July 16, 1851</p>

<p>Here I am thirty-four years old, and yet my life is almost wholly unexpanded. How much is in the germ! There is such an interval between my ideal and the actual in many instances that I may say I am unborn. There is the instinct for society, but no society. Life is not long enough for one success. Within another thirty-four years that miracle can hardly take place. Methinks my seasons revolve more slowly than those of nature; I am differently timed. I am contented. This rapid revolution of nature, even of nature in me, why should it hurry me? Let a man step to the music which he hears, however measured. Is it important that I should mature as soon as an apple tree? aye, as soon as an oak? May not my life in nature, in proportion as it is supernatural, be only the spring and infantile portion of my spirit's life? Shall I turn my spring to summer? May I not sacrifice a hasty and petty completeness here to entireness there? If my curve is large, why bend it to a smaller circle? My spirit's unfolding observes not the pace of nature. The society which I was made for is not here. Shall I, then, substitute for the anticipation of that this poor reality? I would rather have the unmixed expectation of that than this reality. If life is a waiting, so be it. I will not be shipwrecked on a vain reality.
<p>&mdash;Journal, July 19, 1851</p>

<p>I did not read books the first summer; I hoed beans. Nay, I often did better than this. There were times when I could not afford to sacrifice the bloom of the present moment to any work, whether of the head or hands. I love a broad margin to my life. Sometimes, in a summer morning, having taken my accustomed bath, I sat in my sunny doorway from sunrise till noon, rapt in a revery, amidst the pines and hickories and sumachs, in undisturbed solitude and stillness, while the birds sing around or flitted noiseless through the house, until by the sun falling in at my west window, or the noise of some traveller's wagon on the distant highway, I was reminded of the lapse of time. I grew in those seasons like corn in the night, and they were far better than any work of the hands would have been. They were not time subtracted from my life, but so much over and above my usual allowance. I realized what the Orientals mean by contemplation and the forsaking of works. For the most part, I minded not how the hours went. The day advanced as if to light some work of mine; it was morning, and lo, now it is evening, and nothing memorable is accomplished. Instead of singing like the birds, I silently smiled at my incessant good fortune.</p>
<p>&mdash;Walden, "Sounds"</p>

<p>What more glorious condition of being can we imagine than from impure to be becoming pure? It is almost desirable to be impure that we may be the subject of this improvement. That I am innocent to myself! That I love and reverence my life! That I am better fitted for a lofty society today than I was yesterday! To make my life a sacrament! What is nature without this lofty tumbling? May I treat myself with more and more respect and tenderness. May I not forget that I am impure and vicious. May I not cease to love purity. May I go to my slumbers as expecting to arise to a new and more perfect day. May I so live and refine my life as fitting myself for a society ever higher than I actually enjoy. May I treat myself tenderly as I would treat the most innocent child whom I love; may I treat children and my friends as my newly discovered self. Let me forever go in search of myself; never for a moment think that I have found myself; be as a stranger to myself, never a familiar, seeking acquaintance still. May I be to myself as one is to me whom I love, a dear and cherished object. What temple, what fane, what sacred place can there be but the innermost part of my own being? The possibility of my own improvement, that is to be cherished. As I regard myself, so I am. O my dear friends, I have not forgotten you. I will know you tomorrow. I associate you with my ideal self. I had ceased to have faith in myself. I thought I was grown up and become what I was intended to be, but it is earliest spring with me. In relation to virtue and innocence the oldest man is in the beginning spring and vernal season of life. It is the love of virtue makes us young ever. That is the fountain of youth, the very aspiration after the perfect. I love and worship myself with a love which absorbs my love for the world. The lecturer suggested to me that I might become better than I am. Was it not a good lecture then? May I dream not that I shunned vice; may I dream that I loved and practiced virtue.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, July 16, 1851</p>

<p>Last night I was reading Howitt's account of the Australian gold-diggings, and had in my mind's eye the numerous valleys with their streams all cut up with foul pits, ten to a hundred feet deep and half a dozen feet across, as close as they can be dug, and half full of water, where men furiously rushed to probe for their fortunes, uncertain where they shall break ground, not knowing but the gold is under their camp itself; sometimes digging a hundred and sixty feet before they strike the vein, or then missing it by a foot; turned into demons and regardless of each other's rights in their thirst after riches; whole valleys for thirty miles suddenly honeycombed by the pits of the miners, so that hundreds are drowned in them. Standing in water and covered with mud and clay, they work night and day, dying of exposure and disease. Having read this and partly forgotten it, I was thinking of my own unsatisfactory life, doing as others do without any fixed star habitually in my eye, my foot not planted on any blessed isle. Then, with that vision of the diggings before me, I asked myself why I might not be washing some gold daily, though it were only the finest particles, or might not sink a shaft down to the gold within me and work that mine. There is a Ballarat or Bendigo for you. What though it were a "Sulky Gully"? Pursue some path, however narrow and crooked, in which you can walk with love and reverence. Wherever a man separates from the multitude and goes his own way, there is a fork in the road, though travellers along the highway see only a gap in the paling....</p>
<p>Men rush to California and Australia as if the true gold were to be found in that direction; but that is to go in the very opposite extreme to where it lies. They go prospecting further and further away from the true lead, and are most unfortunate when most successful. Is not our native soil auriferous? Does not a stream from the golden mountains flow through our native valley? and has it not for more than geologic ages been bringing down the shining particles and the nuggets? Yet, strange to tell, if a digger steal away prospecting for this true gold into the unexplored solitudes, there is no danger, alas, that any will dog his steps and endeavor to supplant him. He may claim and undermine the whole valley, even the cultivated and uninhabited portions, his whole life long in peace, and no one will ever dispute his claim.</p>

<p>I am convinced that men are not well employed, that this is not the way to spend a day. If by patience, if by watching, I can secure one new ray of light, can feel myself elevated for an instant upon Pisgah, the world which was dead prose to me become living and divine, shall I not watch ever? shall I not be a watchman henceforth? If by watching a whole year on the city's walls I may obtain a communication from heaven, shall I not do well to shut up my shop and turn a watchman? Can a youth, a man, do more wisely than to go where his life is to be found? As if I had suffered that to be rumor which may be verified. We are surrounded by a rich and fertile mystery. May we not probe it, pry into it, employ ourselves about it, a little? To devote your life to the discovery of the divinity in nature or to the eating of oysters, would they not be attended with very different results?</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, September 7, 1851</p>

<p>I go to Flint's Pond for the sake of the mountain view from the hill beyond, looking over Concord. I have thought it the best, especially in the winter, which I can get in this neighborhood. It is worth the while to see the mountains in the horizon once a day. I have thus seen some earth which corresponds to my least earthly and trivial, to my most heavenward-looking, thoughts. The earth seen through an azure, an ethereal, veil. They are the natural <em>temples</em>, elevated brows, of the earth, looking at which, the thoughts of the beholder are naturally elevated and sublimed &mdash; etherealized. I wish to see the earth through the medium of much air or heaven, for there is no paint like the air. Mountains thus seen are worthy of worship. I go to Flint's Pond also to see a rippling lake and a reedy island in its midst &mdash; Reed Island. A man should feed his senses with the best that the land affords.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the Deep Cut, I heard the telegraph-wire vibrating like an aeolian harp. It reminded me suddenly &mdash; reservedly, with a beautiful paucity of communication, even silently, such was its effect on my thoughts &mdash; it reminded me, I say, with a certain pathetic moderation, of what finer and deeper stirrings I was susceptible, which grandly set all argument and dispute aside, a triumphant though transient exhibition of the truth. It told me by the faintest imaginable strain, it told me by the finest strain that a human ear can hear, yet conclusively and past all refutation, that there were higher, infinitely higher, planes of life which it behooved me never to forget. As I was entering the Deep Cut, the wind, which was conveying a message to me from heaven, dropped it on the wire of the telegraph which it vibrated as it passed. I instantly sat down on a stone at the foot of the telegraph-pole, and attended to the communication. It merely said: "Bear in mind, Child, and never for an instant forget, that there are higher planes, infinitely higher planes, of life than this thou art travelling on. Know that the goal is distant, and is upward, and is worthy of all your life's efforts to attain to." And then it ceased, and though I sat some minutes longer I heard nothing more.</p>

<p>The value of the mountains in the horizon &mdash; would not that be a good theme for a lecture? The text for a discourse in real values, and permanent; a sermon on the mount. They are stepping-stones to heaven &mdash; as the rider has a horse-block at his gate &mdash; by which to mount when we would commence our pilgrimage to heaven; by which we gradually take our departure from earth, from the time when our youthful eyes first rested on them &mdash; from this bare actual earth, which has so little of the hue of heaven. They make it easier to die and easier to live....</p>
<p>They are valuable to mankind as is the iris of the eye to a man. They are the path of the translated. The undisputed territory between earth and heaven. In our travels rising higher and higher, we at length got to where the earth was blue. Suggesting that this earth, unless our conduct curse it, is as celestial as that sky. They are the pastures to which we drive our thoughts on these 20ths of May.</p>

<p>I am sane only when I have risen above my common sense, when I do not take the foolish view of things which is commonly taken, when I do not live for the low ends for which men commonly live. Wisdom is not common. To what purposes have I senses, if I am thus absorbed in affairs? My pulse must beat with nature. After a hard day's work without a thought, turning my very brain into a mere tool, only in the quiet of evening do I so far recover my senses as to hear the cricket, which in fact has been chirping all day. In my better hours I am conscious of the influx of a supreme and unquestionable wisdom which partly unfits, and if I yielded to it more rememberingly would wholly unfit me, for what is called the active business of life, for that furnishes nothing on which the eye of reason can rest. What is that other kind of life to which I am thus continually allured? which alone I love? Is it a life for this world? Can a man feed and clothe himself gloriously who keeps only the truth steadily before him? who calls me in no evil to his aid? Are there duties which necessarily interfere with the serene perception of truth? Are our serene moments mere foretastes of heaven &mdash; joys gratuitously vouchsafed to us as a consolation &mdash; or simply a transient realization of what might be the whole tenor of our lives?</p>
<p>To be calm, to be serene! There is the calmness of the lake when there is not a breath of wind; there is the calmness of a stagnant ditch. So it is with us. Sometimes we are clarified and calmed healthily, as we never were before in our lives, not by an opiate, but by some unconscious obedience to the all-just laws so that we become like a still lake of purest crystal and without an effort our depths are revealed to ourselves. All the world goes by us and is reflected in our deeps. Such clarity! obtained by such pure means! by simple living, by honesty of purpose. We live and rejoice. I awoke into a music which no one about me heard. Whom shall I thank for it? The luxury of wisdom! the luxury of virtue! Are there any intemperate in these things? I feel my Maker blessing me. To the sane man the world is a musical instrument. The very touch affords an exquisite pleasure. </p>

<p>What I was learning in college was chiefly, I think, to express myself, and I see now, that as the old orator prescribed, 1st, action; 2d, action; 3d, action; my teachers should have prescribed to me, 1st, sincerity; 2d, sincerity; 3d, sincerity. The old mythology is incomplete without a god or goddess of sincerity, on whose altars we might offer up all the products of our farms, our workshops, and our studies. It should be our Lar when we sit on the hearth, and our Tutelar Genius when we walk abroad. This is the only panacea. I mean sincerity in our dealings with ourselves mainly; any other is comparatively easy. But I must stop before I get to 17thly. I believe I have but one text and one sermon.</p>
<p>&mdash;Letter to Richard F. Fuller, April 2, 1843</p>

<p>We may grow old with the vigor of youth. Are we not always in youth so long as we face heaven? We may always live the morning of our days. To him who seeks early, the sun never gets over the edge of the hill, but his rays fall slanting forever.</p>

<p>Why should we not still continue to live with the intensity and rapidity of infants? Is not the world, are not the heavens, as unfathomed as ever? Have we exhausted any joy, any sentiment?</p>

<p>The life in us is like the water in the river. It may rise this year higher than man has ever known it, and flood the parched uplands; even this may be the eventful year, which will drown out all our muskrats. It was not always dry land where we dwell. I see far inland the banks which the stream anciently washed, before science began to record its freshets. Every one has heard the story which has gone the rounds of New England, of a strong and beautiful bug which came out of the dry leaf of an old table of apple-tree wood, which had stood in a farmer's kitchen for sixty years, first in Connecticut, and afterward in Massachusetts &mdash; from an egg deposited in the living tree many years earlier still, as appeared by counting the annual layers beyond it; which was heard gnawing out for several weeks, hatched perchance by the heat of an urn. Who does not feel his faith in a resurrection and immortality strengthened by hearing of this? Who knows what beautiful and winged life, whose egg has been buried for ages under many concentric layers of woodenness in the dead dry life of society, deposited at first in the alburnum of the green and living tree, which has been gradually converted into the semblance of its well-seasoned tomb &mdash; heard perchance gnawing out now for years by the astonished family of man, as they sat round the festive board &mdash; may unexpectedly come forth from amidst society's most trivial and handselled furniture, to enjoy its perfect summer life at last!</p>

<p>If one listens to the faintest but constant suggestions of his genius, which are certainly true, he sees not to what extremes, or even insanity, it may lead him; and yet that way, as he grows more resolute and faithful, his road lies. The faintest assured objection which one healthy man feels will at length prevail over the arguments and customs of mankind. No man ever followed his genius till it misled him. Though the result were bodily weakness, yet perhaps no one can say that the consequences were to be regretted, for these were a life in conformity to higher principles. If the day and the night are such that you greet them with joy, and life emits a fragrance like flowers and sweet-scented herbs, is more elastic, more starry, more immortal &mdash; that is your success. All nature is your congratulation, and you have cause momentarily to bless yourself. The greatest gains and values are farthest from being appreciated. We easily come to doubt if they exist. We soon forget them. They are the highest reality. Perhaps the facts most astounding and most real are never communicated by man to man. The true harvest of my daily life is somewhat as intangible and indescribable as the tints of morning or evening. It is a little star-dust caught, a segment of the rainbow which I have clutched.</p>

<p>The swamp amelanchier is leafing again, as usual. What a pleasing phenomenon, perhaps an Indian-summer growth, an anticipation of the spring, like the notes of birds and frogs, etc., an evidence of warmth and genialness. Its buds are annually awakened by the October sun as if it were spring. The shad-bush is leafing again by the sunny swamp-side. It is like a youthful or poetic thought in old age. Several times I have been cheered by this sight when surveying in former years. The chickadee seems to lisp a sweeter note at the sight of it. I would not fear the winter more than the shad-bush which puts forth fresh and tender leaves on its approach. In the fall I will take this for my coat-of-arms. It seems to detain the sun that expands it. These twigs are so full of life that they can hardly contain themselves. They ignore winter. They anticipate spring. What faith! Away in some warm and sheltered recess in the swamp you find where these leaves have expanded. It is a foretaste of spring. In my latter years, let me have some <em>shad-bush</em> thoughts.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to walk over the beds of these fresh, crisp, and rustling leaves. How beautifully they go to their graves! how gently lay themselves down and turn to mould! &mdash; painted of a thousand hues, and fit to make the beds of us living. So they troop to their last resting-place, light and frisky. They put on no weeds, but merrily they go scampering over the earth, selecting the spot, choosing a lot, ordering no iron fence, whispering all through the woods about it &mdash; some choosing the spot where the bodies of men are mouldering beneath, and meeting them half-way. How many flutterings before they rest quietly in their graves! They that soared so loftily, how contentedly they return to dust again, and are laid low, resigned to lie and decay at the foot of the tree, and afford nourishment to new generations of their kind, as well as to flutter on high! They teach us how to die. One wonders if the time will ever come when men, with their boasted faith in immortality, will lie down as gracefully and as ripe &mdash; with such an Indian-summer serenity will shed their bodies, as they do their hair and nails.</p>
<p>&mdash;"Autumnal Tints"</p>

<p>I hear one cricket singing still, faintly deep in the bank, now after one whitening of snow. His theme is life immortal. The last cricket, full of cheer and faith, piping to himself, as the last man might.</p>

<p>Be resolutely and faithfully what you are; be humbly what you aspire to be. Be sure you give men the best of your wares, though they be poor enough, and the gods will help you to lay up a better store for the future.</p>

<p>I would meet the morning and evening on very sincere ground. When the sun introduces me to a new day, I silently say to myself, "Let us be faithful all round; we will do justice and receive it." Something like this is the secret charm of Nature's demeanor toward us, strict conscientiousness and disregard of us when we have ceased to have regard for ourselves.</p>

<p>We are wont to forget that the sun looks on our cultivated fields and on the prairies and forests without distinction. They all reflect and absorb his rays alike, and the former make but a small part of the glorious picture which he beholds in his daily course. In his view the earth is all equally cultivated like a garden. Therefore we should receive the benefit of his light and heat with a corresponding trust and magnanimity. What though I value the seed of these beans, and harvest that in the fall of the year? This broad field which I have looked at so long looks not to me as the principal cultivator, but away from me to influences more genial to it, which water and make it green. These beans have results which are not harvested by me. Do they not grow for woodchucks partly? The ear of wheat (in Latin spica, obsoletely speca, from spe, hope) should not be the only hope of the husbandman; its kernel or grain (granum from gerendo, bearing) is not all that it bears. How, then, can our harvest fail? Shall I not rejoice also at the abundance of the weeds whose seeds are the granary of the birds? It matters little comparatively whether the fields fill the farmer's barns. The true husbandman will cease from anxiety, as the squirrels manifest no concern whether the woods will bear chestnuts this year or not, and finish his labor with every day, relinquishing all claim to the produce of his fields, and sacrificing in his mind not only his first but his last fruits also.</p>
<p>&mdash;Walden, "The Bean-Field"</p>

<p>Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind. With respect to luxuries and comforts, the wisest have ever lived a more simple and meagre life than the poor. The ancient philosophers, Chinese, Hindoo, Persian, and Greek, were a class than which none has been poorer in outward riches, none so rich in inward. We know not much about them. It is remarkable that we know so much of them as we do. The same is true of the more modern reformers and benefactors of their race. None can be an impartial or wise observer of human life but from the vantage ground of what we should call voluntary poverty. Of a life of luxury the fruit is luxury, whether in agriculture, or commerce, or literature, or art. There are nowadays professors of philosophy, but not philosophers. Yet it is admirable to profess because it was once admirable to live. To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically. The success of great scholars and thinkers is commonly a courtier-like success, not kingly, not manly. They make shift to live merely by conformity, practically as their fathers did, and are in no sense the progenitors of a noble race of men. But why do men degenerate ever? What makes families run out? What is the nature of the luxury which enervates and destroys nations? Are we sure that there is none of it in our own lives? The philosopher is in advance of his age even in the outward form of his life. He is not fed, sheltered, clothed, warmed, like his contemporaries. How can a man be a philosopher and not maintain his vital heat by better methods than other men?</p>

<h3>1. Farm (February 7)</h3>
<ul>
<li>theme: aspiration</li>
<li>farm = "that over which you have firm possession"</li>
<li>building a firm foundation for your life (cf conclusion of Walden)</li>
<li>dharma = what is established or firm, i.e., the right way of living</li>
<li>the upland farmer is a cultivator of dharma!</li>
<li>there is nothing over which you have firmer possession than your self (self-possession, self-mastery)</li>
<li>as in the Bhagavat-Gita, the field is the self ("being-field", "to make the soul say being")</li>
<li>beauty and use, heaven and earth, ideal and real, the transcendental and the natural</li>
<li>the progression from lowland farm (practical life) to the upland farm (transcendental experience)</li>
<li>cultivation is individual (footpath)</li>
<li>no shortcuts or mechanical aids</li>
<li>cultivation as working with nature, and the tension inherent there</li>
<li>trust, magnanimity, independence, and simplicity as spring, summer, autumn, and winter virtues (trust in self, grandeur of soul, independence of mind, simplicity of living)</li>
<li>seed, seedling, tree, flower, fruit, leaf, bud - natural expressions of one's human potential, which must be actively cultivated to reach fruition</li>
<li>Varro's seasons (beginning February 7): preparing, planting, cultivating, harvesting, storing, offering for sale</li>
<li>different natural timescales: day, year, life; "The day is an epitome of the year. The night is the winter, the morning and evening are the spring and fall, and the noon is the summer." (Walden, Spring)</li>
<li>"the connecting link between wild and culivated fields" (Walden, The Bean-Field)</li>
<li>apply the methods of <a href='http://www.monadnock.net/thoreau/reading.html'>Reading</a> to Walden and his Journal</li>
<li>"as some must work in fields if only for the sake of tropes and expression, to serve a parable maker someday" (Walden, The Bean-Field)</li>
<li>Thoreau's words "express our faith and piety" and "admit of more than one interpretation"; "yet they are significant and fragrant like frankincense to superior natures" (Walden, Conclusion)</li>
<li>A system of images and analogies and metaphors, comprising a veritable castle in the air, under which you must build a foundation in your own life as I must in mine.</li>
<li>connection to heroes of Bhagavad Gita: Yudhishthira (steadfastness, truthfulness, discipline / self-control, integrity, trust), Bhima (strength, courage, magnanimity, nobility), Nakula (love, wisdom, independence), Sahadeva (piety, spirituality, simplicity, justice) - with Arjuna representing focus, concentration, aiming for and hitting the target (cf Aristotle on hamartia) - see also Hadot on the present moment: this is the great point on which the wise man concentrates</li>

<blockquote>
Some absorbing employment on your higher ground,—your upland farm,—whither no cart-path leads, but where you mount alone with your hoe,—where the life everlasting grows; there you raise a crop which needs not to be brought down into the valley to a market; which you barter for heavenly products. -- Letter to Harrison Blake, May 28th, 1850
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
All the world complain nowadays of a press of trivial duties and engagements, which prevents their employing themselves on some higher ground they know of; but, undoubtedly, if they were made of the right stuff to work on that higher ground, provided they were released from all those engagements, they would now at once fulfill the superior engagement, and neglect all the rest, as naturally as they breathe. -- Letter to Harrison Blake, July 21st, 1852
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The problem of life becomes, one cannot say by how many degrees, more complicated as our material wealth is increased,—whether that needle they tell of was a gateway or not,—since the problem is not merely nor mainly to get life for our bodies, but by this or a similar discipline to get life for our souls; by cultivating the lowland farm on right principles, that is, with this view, to turn it into an upland farm. You have so many more talents to account for. If I accomplish as much more in spiritual work as I am richer in worldly goods, then I am just as worthy, or worth just as much, as I was before, and no more. I see that, in my own case, money might be of great service to me, but probably it would not be; for the difficulty now is, that I do not improve my opportunities, and therefore I am not prepared to have my opportunities increased. Now, I warn you, if it be as you say, you have got to put on the pack of an upland farmer in good earnest the coming spring, the lowland farm being cared for; ay, you must be selecting your seeds forthwith, and doing what winter work you can; and, while others are raising potatoes and Baldwin apples for you, you must be raising apples of the Hesperides for them. (Only hear how he preaches!) No man can suspect that he is the proprietor of an upland farm,—upland in the sense that it will produce nobler crops, and better repay cultivation in the long run,—but he will be perfectly sure that he ought to cultivate it. --Letter to Harrison Blake, February 27th, 1853
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. He will put some things behind, will pass an invisible boundary; new, universal, and more liberal laws will begin to establish themselves around and within him; or the old laws be expanded, and interpreted in his favor in a more liberal sense, and he will live with the license of a higher order of beings. In proportion as he simplifies his life, the laws of the universe will appear less complex, and solitude will not be solitude, nor poverty poverty, nor weakness weakness. If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them. -- Walden
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
There are nowadays professors of philosophy, but not philosophers. Yet it is admirable to profess because it was once admirable to live. To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically. -- Walden
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I do not speak to those who are well employed, in whatever circumstances, and they know whether they are well employed or not; — but mainly to the mass of men who are discontented, and idly complaining of the hardness of their lot or of the times, when they might improve them. There are some who complain most energetically and inconsolably of any, because they are, as they say, doing their duty. I also have in my mind that seemingly wealthy, but most terribly impoverished class of all, who have accumulated dross, but know not how to use it, or get rid of it, and thus have forged their own golden or silver fetters. -- Walden
</blockquote>

<p>Although Thoreau is often felt to be a kind of mountain man or noble savage, he favored a blending of civilization and wildness - and he has much to teach us about the balance between work and leisure, indoor pursuits and outdoor pursuits, technology and nature, society and solitude, reflection and action, theory and practice, cooperation and independence, complexity and simplicity, the human and the natural. You or I might not place the balance point where he did on all those dimensions, but walking with Thoreau will certainly get each of us thinking about where it belongs.</p>

<h3>2. Seed (early March)</h3>
<ul>
<li>theme: awakening</li>
<li>"that which is sowed"</li>
<li>related to "season" and "secular"</li>
<li>awareness, aspiration, and choice</li>
<li>higher possibilities</li>
<li>"selecting your seeds forthwith"</li>
<li>actively choosing to pursue a higher life - living deliberately</li>
<li>crops of the upland farm: arbor vitae, apples of the Hesperides, life everlasting (common thread of immortality)</li>
<li>in practice, what does it mean to choose to cultivate crops of *immortality*? idealism, higher goals, nobler actions</li>
<li>the benefits of idealism that accrue even without achieving one's ideal: hewing to a higher path, maintaining one's individuality, keeping one's own counsel, expecting of oneself a nobler course of action</li>
<li>also, each season has its distinctive crops: take advantage of one's opportunities at all times (April 11, 1859)</li>
<li>this-worldly focus of appropriate action without delay</li>
<li>reap what you sow, so choose your seeds deliberately</li>
<li>lessons from chapter two of Walden: morning invitation to simplicity and innocence; awakening to a higher life; one's Genius tries again a noble life; moral reform as throwing off sleep; elevate my life by conscious endeavor; to affect the quality of the day is the highest of arts; make my life worthy of the contemplation of my most elevated and critical hour; to live deliberately; a stern simplicity of life and elevation of purpose; only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence; settle myself in reality</li>
<li>"In the long run men hit only what they aim at. Therefore ... They should aim at something high."</li>
<li>"how to get my living honestly, with freedom left for my proper pursuits"</li>
<li>making sure your pursuits are worthy</li>
<li>"rise to a higher and more ethereal life"</li>
<li>unconscious truthfulness and nobleness and beauty of life</li>
<li>"follow the bent of my genius"</li>
<li>Higher Laws: "the seeds of a better life in him"</li>
<li>"if one listens to the faintest but constant suggestions of his genius" and "grows more resolute and faithful", then "the day and the night are such that you greet them with joy" - this is "success" and "the true harvest of my daily life" (Walden, Higher Laws)</li>
<li>purity, chastity, temperence in Higher Laws (a divine life but not for mere mortals); yet how to capture some of that ethereal quality? "to practise some new austerity, to let his mind descend into his body and redeem it, to treat himself with ever increasing respect"</li>
<li>"explore your own higher latitudes", the worlds of thought; be the lord of a celestial empire within you; have sympathy with the spirit that animates your clay; explore continents and seas in the moral world; explore the private sea of one's being alone; explore thyself</li>
<li>"obedience to yet more sacred laws", to "the laws of his being"</li>
<li>related to advancing confidently in the direction of your dreams, because that establishes new laws around and within you (the license of a higher order of beings) and puts a foundation under the life you have imagined</li>
</ul>

<p>A seed, which is a plant or tree in embryo, which has the principle of growth, of life, in it, is more important in my eyes, and in the economy of Nature, than the diamond of Kohinoor.</p> <p>&mdash;Journal, March 22, 1861</p>

<p>Events, circumstances, etc., have their origin in ourselves. They spring from seeds which we have sown.</p> <p>&mdash;Journal, April 27, 1854</p>

<p>Do you not feel the fruit of your spring and summer begin to ripen, to harden its seed within you? Do not your thoughts begin to acquire consistency as well as flavor and ripeness? How can we expect a harvest of thought who have not had a seed-time of character? Already some of my small thoughts &mdash; fruit of my spring life &mdash; are ripe, like the berries which feed the first broods of birds; and other some are prematurely ripe and bright, like the lower leaves of the herbs which have felt the summer's drought.</p> <p>&mdash;Journal, August 7, 1854</p>

<p>I will not plant beans and corn with so much industry another summer, but such seeds, if the seed is not lost, as sincerity, truth, simplicity, faith, innocence, and the like, and see if they will not grow in this soil, even with less toil and manurance, and sustain me, for surely it has not been exhausted for these crops. (Walden, The Bean-Field)</p>

<p>Now that we are casting away these melon seeds, how can we help feeling reproach?  He who eats the fruit, should at least plant the seed; aye, if possible, a better seed than that whose fruit he has enjoyed.  Seeds!  there are seeds enough which need only to be stirred in with the soil where they lie, by an inspired voice or pen, to bear fruit of a divine flavor.  O thou spendthrift!  Defray thy debt to the world; eat not the seed of institutions, as the luxurious do, but plant it rather, while thou devourest the pulp and tuber for thy subsistence; that so, perchance, one variety may at last be found worthy of preservation.</p> <p>&mdash;A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, Monday, September 2, 1839</p>

<p>What is hope, what is expectation, but a seed-time whose harvest cannot fail, an irresistable expedition of the mind, at length to be victorious?</p> <p>&mdash;Journal, February 20, 1857</p>

<h3>3. Preparing (late March)</h3>
<ul>
<li>theme: deliberation / living deliberately</li>
<li>"making ready"</li>
<li>"put on the pack of an upland farmer in good earnest"</li>
<li>upland farmer has only a small pack: no horses or tractors or plows or greenhouses etc.; work with your hands and take advantage of nature; relying on yourself</li>
<li>the need of preparation and planning for life</li>
<li>the importance and role of intention in human activities</li>
<li>the soul as a garden or orchard, not a wild field or forest</li>
<li>sharpening your tools</li>
<li>tool derives from "to make with the hands, to do or create"</li>
<li>"only a hoe for cart and two hands to draw it - there being an aversion to other carts and horses"</li>
<li>knife, axe, spade, wheelbarrow (Walden, Economy)</li>
<li>some metaphorical tools: a spade for settling your seedlings down below the mud and slush of opinion etc.; a hoe for weeding out distractions; shears for pruning back your desires; a pail for meting out the water of attention (see Walden ch 8)</li>
<li>some mental aptitudes: observation / alertness ("being forever on the alert", Walden ch 3); sincerity / honesty with yourself; patience; discipline / stoicism; diligence / persistence ; studiousness; vigor / strength / endurance; focus; curiosity; elasticity; a critical eye toward oneself; etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion. For most men, it appears to me, are in a strange uncertainty about it, whether it is of the devil or of God, and have somewhat hastily concluded that it is the chief end of man here to "glorify God and enjoy him forever."</p> <p>&mdash;Walden, "Where I Lived, and What I Lived For"</p>

<p>It is foolish for a man to accumulate material wealth chiefly, houses and land. Our stock in life, our real estate, is that amount of thought which we have had, which we have thought out. The ground we have thus created is forever pasturage for our thoughts. I fall back on to visions which I have had. What else adds to my possessions and makes me rich in all lands? If you have ever done any work with these finest tools, the imagination and fancy and reason, it is a new creation, independent on the world, and a possession forever. You have laid up something against a rainy day. You have to that extent cleared the wilderness.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, May 1, 1857</p>

<p>I have come out this afternoon a-cranberrying, chiefly to gather some of the small cranberry, <em>Vaccinium Oxycoccus</em>, which Emerson says is the common cranberry of the north of Europe. This was a small object, yet not to be postponed, on account of imminent frosts, i.e., if I would know this year the flavor of the European cranberry as compared with our larger kind. I thought I should like to have a dish of this sauce on the table at Thanksgiving of my own gathering. I could hardly make up my mind to come this way, it seemed so poor an object to spend the afternoon on. I kept foreseeing a lame conclusion &mdash; how should I cross the Great Fields, look into Beck Stow's, and then retrace my steps no richer than before. In fact, I expected little of this walk, yet it did pass through the side of my mind that somehow, on this very account (my small expectation), it would turn out well, as also the advantage of having some purpose, however small, to be accomplished &mdash; of letting your deliberate wisdom and foresight in the house to some extent direct and control your steps. If you would really take a position outside the street and daily life of men, you must have deliberately planned your course, you must have business which is not your neighbors' business, which they cannot understand. For only absorbing employment prevails, succeeds, takes up space, occupies territory, determines the future of individuals and states, drives Kansas out of your head, and actually and permanently occupies the only desirable and free Kansas against all border ruffians. The attitude of resistance is one of weakness, inasmuch as it only faces an enemy; it has its back to all that is truly attractive. You shall have your affairs, I will have mine. You will spend this afternoon in setting up your neighbor's stove, and be paid for it; I will spend it in gathering the few berries of the <em>Vaccinium Oxycoccus</em> which Nature produces here, before it is too late, and be paid for it also after another fashion. I have always reaped unexpected and incalculable advantages from carrying out at last however tardily, any little enterprise which my genius suggested to me long ago as a thing to be done &mdash; some step to be taken, however slight, out of the usual course.</p>
<p>How many schools I have thought of which I might go to but did not go to! expecting foolishly that some greater advantage or schooling would come to me! It is these comparatively cheap and private expeditions that substantiate our existence and batten our lives as where a vine touches the earth in its undulating course, it puts forth roots and thickens its stock. Our employment generally is tinkering, mending the old worn-out teapot of society. Our stock in trade is solder. Better for me, says my genius, to go cranberrying this afternoon for the <em>Vaccinium Oxycoccus</em> in Gowing's Swamp, to get but a pocketful and learn its peculiar flavor, aye, and the flavor of Gowing's Swamp and of <em>life</em> in New England, than to go consul to Liverpool and get I don't know how many thousand dollars for it, with no such flavor. Many of our days should be spent, not in vain expectations and lying on our oars, but in carrying out deliberately and faithfully the hundred little purposes which every man's genius must have suggested to him. Let not your life be wholly without an object, though it be only to ascertain the flavor of a cranberry, for it will not be only the quality of an insignificant berry that you will have tasted, but the flavor of your life to that extent, and it will be such a sauce as no wealth can buy.</p>
<p>Both a conscious and an unconscious life are good. Neither is good exclusively, for both have the same source. The wisely conscious life springs out of an unconscious suggestion.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, August 30, 1856</p>

<p>Some hours seem not to be occasion for any deed, but for resolves to draw breath in.  We do not directly go about the execution of the purpose that thrills us, but shut our doors behind us and ramble with prepared mind, as if the half were already done. Our resolution is taking root or hold on the earth then, as seeds first send a shoot downward which is fed by their own albumen, ere they send one upward to the light.</p> <p>&mdash;A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, Sunday, September 1, 1839</p>

<h3>4. Seedling (April 19?)</h3>
<ul>
<li>theme: elasticity / resilience / strength of spirit / originality</li>
<li>seedling (originality) vs. sprout (offshoot) in Thoreau's late research on trees</li>
<li>having your own roots, following your genius</li>
<li>"a young twig or spray"</li>
<li>indoor growth before exposure and planting</li>
<li>but no greenhouse at the upland farm so need to find a sheltered spot facing south</li>
<li>raised beds and other contrivances</li>
<li>risk of late frosts</li>
<li>dodging of pressures / Bourne</li>
<li>the budding of life</li>
<li>the running of sap (as in New England maple trees)</li>
<li>hope and the promise of spring</li>
<li>the arrival of the earliest spring birds</li>
<li>thawing and melting and the attendant messiness of youth</li>
<li>springing up and forward with vigor and energy and hope in the future</li>
<li>the ice-out of rivers and lakes</li>
<li>"Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth. Rise free from care before the dawn, and seek adventures."</li>
<li>"Grow wild according to thy nature"</li>
<li>have "enterprise and faith" to live free</li>
<li>"We should come home from far, from adventures, and perils, and discoveries every day, with new experience and character." </li>
<li>"the first tender signs of the infant year"</li>
<li>the germ of what I'll leave behind in the fall of life or year or day is found in the leaves that sprout in spring</li>
<li>many shades greener (ch 17)</li>
<li>"our prospects brighten on the influx of better thoughts"</li>
<li>"our own recovered innocence"</li>
<li>"blessed if we lived in the present always"</li>
<li>"some innocent fair shoots" will "try another year's life, tender and fresh as the youngest plant"</li>
<li>"a return to goodness" each morning "as the sprouts of the forest which has been felled"</li>
</ul>

<p>The change from foul weather to fair, from dark, sluggish hours to serene, elastic ones, is a memorable crisis which all things proclaim.</p> <p>&mdash;Journal, March 26, 1846</p>

<p>To him whose elastic and vigorous thought keeps pace with the sun, the day is a perpetual morning. (Walden, Where I Lived and What I Lived For)</p>

<p>I came near awaking this morning. I am older than last year; the mornings are further between; the days are fewer. Any excess &mdash; to have drunk too much water, even, the day before &mdash; is fatal to the morning's clarity, but in health the sound of a cow-bell is celestial music. Oh, might I always wake to thought and poetry &mdash; regenerated! Can it be called a morning, if our senses are not clarified so that we perceive more clearly, if we do not rise with elastic vigor?</p> <p>&mdash;Journal, July 7, 1852</p>

<p>I look at a young fox at Derby's. You would say from his step and motions that his legs were as elastic as india-rubber &mdash; all springs, ready at an instant to bound high into the air. Gravity seems not enough to keep him in contact with the earth. There seems to be a peculiar principle of resiliency constantly operating in him.</p> <p>&mdash;Journal, July 11, 1860</p>

<p>How meanly and miserably we live for the most part! We escape fate continually by the skin of our teeth, as the saying is. We are practically desperate. But as every man, in respect to material wealth, aims to become independent or wealthy, so, in respect to our spirits and imagination, we should have some spare capital and superfluous vigor, have some margin and leeway in which to move. What kind of gift is life unless we have spirits to enjoy it and taste its true flavor? if, in respect to spirits, we are to be forever cramped and in debt? In our ordinary estate we have not, so to speak, quite enough air to breathe, and this poverty qualifies our piety; but we should have more than enough and breathe it carelessly. Poverty is the rule. We should first of all be full of vigor like a strong horse, and beside have the free and adventurous spirit of his driver; i.e., we should have such a reserve of elasticity and strength that we may at any time be able to put ourselves at the top of our speed and go beyond our ordinary limits.</p> <p>&mdash;Journal, August 10, 1857</p>

<p>Some poets have said that writing poetry was for youths only, but not so. In that fervid and excitable season we only get the impulse which is to carry us onward in our future career. Ideals are then exhibited to us distinctly which all our lives after we may aim at but not attain. The mere vision is little compared with the steady corresponding endeavor thitherward. It would be vain for us to be looking ever into promised lands toward which in the meanwhile we were not steadily and earnestly travelling, whether the way led over a mountain-top or through a dusky valley. In youth, when we are most elastic and there is a spring to us, we merely receive an impulse in the proper direction. To suppose that this is equivalent to having travelled the road, or obeyed the impulse faithfully throughout a lifetime, is absurd. We are shown fair scenes in order that we may be tempted to inhabit them, and not simply tell what we have seen.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, November 24, 1857</p>

<p>What is hope, what is expectation, but a seed-time whose harvest cannot fail, an irresistable expedition of the mind, at length to be victorious?</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, February 20, 1857</p>

<h3>5. Planting (May 6)</h3>
<ul>
<li>theme: nurturing / discipline</li>
<li>"to place into the ground to start growing"</li>

<li>what is the virtue here? earnestness? seriousness?</li>
<li>the virtue is both moral and intellectual</li>

<li>correspondences between morning, youth, spring</li>
<li>learning about oneself / self-knowledge</li>
<li>learning self-discipline (cf. yoga as discipline)</li>
</ul>

<p>"A man tracks himself through life. One should be always on the trail of one's own deepest nature. For it is the fearless living out of your own essential nature that connects you to the Divine." (source?)</p>

<p>When I witness the first plowing and planting, I acquire a long-lost confidence in the earth &mdash; that it will nourish the seed that is committed to its bosom.</p> <p>&mdash;Journal, March 28, 1857</p>

<p>I will not plant beans another summer, but sincerity, truth, simplicity, faith, trust, innocence, and see if they will not grow in this soil with such manure as I have, and sustain me.</p> <p>&mdash;Journal, August 15, 1845</p>

<p>It is of no use to plow deeper than the soil is, unless you mean to follow up that mode of cultivation persistently, manuring highly and carting on muck at each plowing &mdash; making a soil, in short. Yet many a man likes to tackle mighty themes, like immortality, but in his discourse he turns up nothing but yellow sand, under which what little fertile and available surface soil he may have is quite buried and lost. He should teach frugality rather &mdash; how to postpone the fatal hour &mdash; should plan a crop of beans. He might have raised enough of these to make a deacon of him, though never a preacher. Many a man runs his plow so deep in heavy or stony soil that it sticks fast in the furrow. It is a great art in the writer to improve from day to day just that soil and fertility which he has, to harvest that crop which his life yields, whatever it may be, not be straining as if to reach apples or oranges when he yields only ground-nuts. He should be digging, not soaring. Just as earnest as your life, so deep is your soil. If strong and deep, you will sow wheat and raise bread of life in it.</p> <p>&mdash;Journal, November 9, 1858</p>

<li>depth and height</li>
<li>growing up in both senses</li>
<li>solidity / steadfastness </li>

<p>Trees have commonly two growths in a year, a spring and a fall growth, and you can see where the first was checked whether by cold or drouth, and wonder what there was in the summer to produce this check, this blight. So it is with man; most have a spring growth only, and never get over this first check to their youthful hopes; but plants of hardier constitution, or perchance planted in a more genial soil, speedily recover themselves, and, though they bear the scar or knot in remembrance of their disappointment, they push forward again and have a vigorous fall growth which is equivalent to a new spring.</p> <p>&mdash;Journal, July 14, 1852</p>

<p>The fruit of a tree is neither in the seed nor the timber &mdash; the full-grown tree &mdash; but it is simply the highest use to which it can be put.</p>

<p>I would not subtract anything from the praise that is due to philanthropy, but merely demand justice for all who by their lives and works are a blessing to mankind. I do not value chiefly a man's uprightness and benevolence, which are, as it were, his stem and leaves.  Those plants of whose greenness withered we make herb tea for the sick serve but a humble use, and are most employed by quacks. I want the flower and fruit of a man; that some fragrance be wafted over from him to me, and some ripeness flavor our intercourse. His goodness must not be a partial and transitory act, but a constant superfluity, which costs him nothing and of which he is unconscious. This is a charity that hides a multitude of sins. The philanthropist too often surrounds mankind with the remembrance of his own cast-off griefs as an atmosphere, and calls it sympathy. We should impart our courage, and not our despair, our health and ease, and not our disease, and take care that this does not spread by contagion.</p> <p>&mdash;Walden, "Economy"</p>

<p>Horticulturalists think that they make flower-gardens, though in their thoughts they are barren and flower-less, but to the poet the earth is a flower-garden wherever he goes, or thinks. Most men can keep a horse or keep up a certain fashionable style of living, but few indeed can keep up great expectations. They justly think very meanly of themselves.</p> <p>&mdash;Journal, May 6, 1858</p>

<p>Again I scent the white water-lily, and a season I had waited for is arrived. How indispensible all these experiences to make up the summer! It is the emblem of purity, and its scent suggests it. Growing in stagnant and muddy water, it bursts up so pure and fair to the eye and so sweet to the scent, as if to show us what purity and sweetness reside in, and can be extracted from, the slime and muck of earth. I think I have plucked the first one that has opened for a mile at least. What confirmation of our hopes is the fragrance of the water-lily! I shall not so soon despair of the world for it, notwithstanding slavery, and the cowardice and want of principle of the North. It suggests that the time may come when man's deeds will smell as sweet. Such, then, is the odor our planet emits. Who can doubt, then, that Nature is young and sound? If Nature can compound this fragrance still annually, I shall believe her still full of vigor, and that there is virtue in man, too, who perceives and loves it. It is as if all the pure and sweet and virtuous was extracted from the slime and decay of earth and presented thus in a flower. The resurrection of virtue! It reminds me that Nature has been partner to no Missouri compromise. I scent no compromise in the fragrance of the white water-lily. In it, the sweet, and pure, and innocent are wholly sundered from the obscene and the baleful. I do not scent in this the time-serving irresolution of a Massachussetts Governor, nor of a Boston Mayor. All good actions have contributed to this fragrance. So behave that the odor of your actions may enhance the general sweetness of the atmosphere, that, when I behold or scent a flower, I may not be reminded how inconsistent are your actions with it; for all odor is but one form of advertisement of a moral quality.</p> <p>&mdash;Journal, June 16, 1854</p>

<p>Men have, perchance, detected every kind of flower that grows in this township, have pursued it with children's eyes into the thickets and darkest woods and swamps, where the painter's color has betrayed it. Have they with proportionate thoroughness plucked every flower of thought which it is possible for a man to entertain, proved every sentiment which it is possible for a man to experience, here? Men have circumnavigated this globe of land and water, but how few have sailed out of sight of common sense over the ocean of knowledge!</p> <p>&mdash;Journal, August 8, 1852</p>

<p>The scenery, when it is truly seen, reacts on the life of the seer. How to live. How to get the most life. As if you were to teach the young hunter how to entrap his game. How to extract honey from the flower of the world. That is my every-day business. I am as busy as a bee about it....</p> <p>&mdash;Journal, August 8, 1852</p>

<h3>9. Cultivating (early July)</h3>
<ul>
<li>theme: persistence / work / karma</li>
<li>"active care"</li>
<li>the upland farm is indeed a farm requiring intentional guidance - pure nature is not enough</li>
<li>water, light, air, space, and soil for the soul</li>
<li>water is like attention or focus; by lavishing attention on what is important, I ensure that I focus on what truly matters (the grass is always greener where you water it)</li>
<li>light is like knowledge, like my understanding of what is possible to me; it is true that the sun shines equally upon the lowland farm and the upland farm, yet the upland light is more regular and more pure, since it is unobstructed by the mists and fogs common to the lowlands</li>
<li>air is like freedom (upland air makes free); by pruning back my desires I free myself up for higher pursuits</li>
<li>space is like solitude (cf. Tao); by weeding out distractions I am more attuned to opportunities for learning and more open to experiences of significance</li>
<li>soil is like inner strength; I nourish the roots of my being with a natural fertilizer formed of the slough and dross of my experience and learning (cf. Thoreau on leaves)</li>

<li>achieving one's essence - an ethereal or ambrosial quality</li>
<li>essence as inward nature or inner seed; cf essential or ambrosial quality of the fruit, and faith in a seed</li>
<li>what it means to be well employed, to be put to my highest use (cf. Walden: "I do not speak to those who are well employed, in whatever circumstances, and they know whether they are well employed or not")</li>
<li>the highest fruit of a person is not their economic use or value but a more essential, ethereal quality: character, individuality, genius, moral beauty, humanity</li>
<li>a free gift of oneself </li>
<li>coming to fruition </li>
<li>realizing one's potential</li>
<li>the apple of the tree of knowledge</li>
<li>beauty, not use</li>

<li>Walden ch 3 on commerce: enterprise and bravery; courage and content; steady and cheerful valor; confident and serene, alert, adventurous, and unwearied; even very natural in its methods</li>
<li>But we "exaggerate the importance of what work we do" (ch 1) and "we may safely trust a good deal more than we do" (ibid).</li>
<li>And "Every path but your own is the path of fate. Keep on your own track, then." (ch 3)</li>
<li>Which is why "I must get off the track and let the cars go by" for "what is the railroad" and "all the restless world" to me? (Ch 3)</li>
<li>A higher, more spiritual employment than commerce: look always at what is to be seen; read your fate and walk on into futurity; pluck the bloom of the present moment; contemplation and meditation; simply smiling at your incessant good fortune; follow your Genius closely enough that your amusement needs to external source or stimulation</li>
<li>See also ch 1 on "finer fruits" and "finest qualities of our nature"</li>
<li>"live simply and wisely"</li>
<li>"I want the flower and fruit of a man." ("some ripeness") ... goodness as a "constant superfluity" ... "a simple and irrepressible satisfaction with gift of life", "be as simple and well as Nature", "endeavor to become one of the worthies of the world"</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The mystery of the life of plants is kindred with that of our own lives, and the physiologist must not presume to explain their growth according to mechanical laws, or as he might explain some machinery of his own making. We must not expect to probe with our fingers the sanctuary of any life, whether animal or vegetable. If we do, we shall discover nothing but surface still. The ultimate expression or fruit of any created thing is a fine effluence which only the most ingenuous worshipper perceives at a reverent distance from its surface even. The cause and the effect are equally evanescent and intangible, and the former must be investigated in the same spirit and with the same reverence with which the latter is perceived. Science is often like the grub which, though it may have nestled in the germ of a fruit, has merely blighted or consumed it and never truly tasted it. Only that intellect makes any progress toward conceiving of the essence which at the same time perceives the effluence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no ripeness which is not, so to speak, something ultimate in itself, and not merely a perfected means to a higher end. In order to be ripe it must serve a transcendent use. The ripeness of a leaf, being perfected, leaves the tree at that point and never returns to it. It has nothing to do with any other fruit which the tree may bear, and only the genius of the poet can pluck it.</p>
<p>The fruit of a tree is neither in the seed nor the timber &mdash; the full-grown tree &mdash; but it is simply the highest use to which it can be put.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some poets mature early and die young. Their fruits have a delicious flavor like strawberries, but do not keep till fall or winter. Others are slower in coming to their growth. Their fruits may be less delicious, but are a more lasting food and are so hardened by the sun of summer and the coolness of autumn that they keep sound over winter. The first are June-eatings, early but soon withering; the last are russets, which last till June again.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, April 8, 1854</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>In summer we live out of doors, and have only impulses and feelings, which are all for action, and must wait commonly for the stillness and longer nights of autumn and winter before any thought will subside; we are sensible that behind the rustling leaves, and the stacks of grain, and the bare clusters of the grape, there is the field of a wholly new life, which no man has lived; that even this earth was made for more mysterious and nobler inhabitants than men and women. In the hues of October sunsets, we see the portals to other mansions than those which we occupy, not far off geographically....</p>
<p>The moon no longer reflects the day, but rises to her absolute rule, and the husbandman and hunter acknowledge her for their mistress. Asters and golden-rods reign along the way, and the life-everlasting withers not. The fields are reaped and shorn of their pride, but an inward verdure still crowns them. The thistle scatters its down on the pool, and yellow leaves clothe the vine, and naught disturbs the serious life of men. But behind the sheaves, and under the sod, there lurks a ripe fruit, which the reapers have not gathered, the true harvest of the year, which it bears forever, annually watering and maturing it, and man never severs the stalk which bears this palatable fruit.</p>

</ul>

<p>A true friend of man; almost the only friend of human progress. An Old Mortality, say rather an Immortality, with unwearied patience and faith making plain the image engraven in men's bodies, the God of whom they are but defaced and leaning monuments. With his hospitable intellect he embraces children, beggars, insane, and scholars, and entertains the thought of all, adding to it commonly some breadth and elegance. I think that he should keep a caravansary on the world's highway, where philosophers of all nations might put up, and on his sign should be printed, "Entertainment for man, but not for his beast. Enter ye that have leisure and a quiet mind, who earnestly seek the right road." He is perhaps the sanest man and has the fewest crotchets of any I chance to know; the same yesterday and tomorrow. Of yore we had sauntered and talked, and effectually put the world behind us; for he was pledged to no institution in it, freeborn, ingenuus. Whichever way we turned, it seemed that the heavens and the earth had met together, since he enhanced the beauty of the landscape. A blue-robed man, whose fittest roof is the overarching sky which reflects his serenity. I do not see how he can ever die; Nature cannot spare him.</p>

<p>What we do best or most perfectly is what we have most thoroughly learned by the longest practice, and at length it falls from us without our notice, as a leaf from a tree. It is the <em>last</em> time we shall do it &mdash; our unconscious leavings.</p> <p>&mdash;Journal, March 11, 1859</p>

<p>Methinks the reflections are never purer and more distinct than now at the season of the fall of the leaf, just before the cool twilight has come, when the air has a finer grain. Just as our mental reflections are more distinct at this season of the year, when the evenings grow cool and lengthen and our winter evenings with their brighter fires may be said to begin. And painted ducks, too, often come and sail or float amid the painted leaves.</p> <p>&mdash;Journal, October 17, 1858</p>

<p>I think that the change to some higher color in a leaf is an evidence that it has arrived at a perfect and final maturity, answering to the maturity of fruits, and not to that of green leaves, etc., etc., which merely serve a purpose. The word "ripe" is thought by some to be derived from the verb "to reap," according to which that is ripe which is ready to be reaped. The fall of the leaf is preceded by a ripe old age.</p> <p>&mdash;Journal, November 12, 1858</p>

<p>Early for several mornings I have heard the sound of a flail. It leads me to ask if I have spent as industrious a spring and summer as the farmer, and gathered as rich a crop of experience. If so, the sound of my flail will be heard by those who have ears to hear, separating the kernel from the chaff all the fall and winter, and a sound no less cheering it will be. If the drought has destroyed the corn, let not all harvests fail. Have you commenced to thresh your grain?</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, August 29, 1854</p>

<p>To tell the truth, I am planning to get seriously to work after these long months of inefficiency and idleness.  I do not know whether you are haunted by any such demon which puts you on the alert to pluck the fruit of each day as it passes, and store it safely in your bin. &mdash;Letter to Daniel Ricketson, October 16, 1855</p>

<p>The fall (strictly speaking) is approaching an end in this probably annual northeast storm. Thus the summer winds up its accounts. The Indians, it is said, did not look for winter till the springs were full. Long-continued rain and wind come to settle the accounts of the year, filling the springs for winter. The ducks and other fowl, reminded of the lateness thus, go by. The few remaining leaves come fluttering down. The snow-flea (as today) is washed out of the bark of meadow trees and covers the surface of the flood. The winter's wood is bargained for and being hauled. This storm reminds men to put things on a winter footing. There is not much more for the farmer to do in the fields. &mdash;Journal, October 27, 1857</p>

<p>I had gone but little way on the old Carlisle road when I saw Brooks Clark, who is now about eighty and bent like a bow, hastening along the road, barefooted, as usual, with an axe in his hand; was in haste perhaps on account of the cold wind on his bare feet. It is he who took the <cite>Centinel</cite> so long. When he got up to me, I saw that beside the axe in one hand, he had his shoes in the other, filled with knurly apples and a dead robin. He stopped and talked with me a few moments; said that we had a noble autumn and might now expect some cold weather. I asked if he had found the robin dead. No, he said, he found it with its wing broken and killed it. He also added that he had found some apples in the woods, and as he hadn't anything to carry them in, he put 'em in his shoes. They were queer looking trays to carry fruit in. How many he got in along toward the toes, I don't know. I noticed, too, that his pockets were stuffed with them. His old tattered frock coat was hanging in strips about the skirts, as were his pantaloons about his naked feet. He appeared to have been out on a scout this gusty afternoon, to see what he could find, as the youngest boy might. It pleased me to see this cheery old man, with such a feeble hold on life, bent almost double, thus enjoying the evening of his days. Far be it from me to call it avarice or penury, this childlike delight in finding something in the woods or fields and carrying it home in the October evening, as a trophy to be added to his winter's store. Oh, no; he was happy to be Nature's pensioner still, and bird-like to pick up his living. Better his robin than your turkey, his shoes full of apples than your barrels full; they will be sweeter and suggest a better tale. He can afford to tell how he got them, and we to listen. There is an old wife too, at home, to share them and hear how they were obtained. Like an old squirrel shuffling to his hole with his nut. Far less pleasing to me the loaded wain, more suggestive of avarice and of spiritual penury.</p>
<p>This old man's cheeriness was worth a thousand of the church's sacraments and memento mori's. It was better than a prayerful mood. It proves to me old age as tolerable, as happy, as infancy. I was glad of an occasion to suspect that this afternoon he had not been at "work" but living somewhat after my own fashion (though he did not explain the axe) &mdash; had been out to see what nature had for him, and now was hastening home to a burrow he knew, where he could warm his old feet. If he had been a young man, he would probably have thrown away his apples and put on his shoes when he saw me coming, for shame. But old age is manlier; it has learned to live, makes fewer apologies, like infancy.</p> 
<p>&mdash;Journal, October 20, 1857</p>

<p>The next winter I used a small cooking-stove for economy, since I did not own the forest; but it did not keep fire so well as the open fireplace. Cooking was then, for the most part, no longer a poetic, but merely a chemic process. It will soon be forgotten, in these days of stoves, that we used to roast potatoes in the ashes, after the Indian fashion. The stove not only took up room and scented the house, but it concealed the fire, and I felt as if I had lost a companion. You can always see a face in the fire. The laborer, looking into it at evening, purifies his thoughts of the dross and earthiness which they have accumulated during the day. But I could no longer sit and look into the fire, and the pertinent words of a poet recurred to me with new force. &mdash;Walden, "House Warming"</p>

<p>I wandered over bare fields where the cattle, lately turned out, roamed restless and unsatisfied with the feed; I dived into a rustling young oak wood where not a green leaf was to be seen; I climbed to the geological axis of elevation and clambered over curly-pated rocks whose strata are on their edges amid the rising woods; and again I thought, They are all gone surely and left me alone. Not a man Friday remains. What nutriment can I extract from these bare twigs? Starvation stares me in the face. "Nay, Nay!" said a nuthatch, making its way, head downward, about a bare hickory close by. "The nearer the bone, the sweeter the meat. Only the superfluous has been swept away. Now we behold the naked truth. If at any time the weather is too cold and bleak for you, keep the sunny side of the trunk, for there is a wholesome and spring warmth such as the summer never afforded. There are the winter mornings with the sun on the oak wood tops. While buds sleep, thoughts wake." ("Hear! Hear!" screamed the jay from a neighboring copse, where I heard a twittering for some time.) "Winter has a concentrated and nutty kernel, if you know where to look for it."</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, November 8, 1858</p>

<p>It is a record of the mellow and ripe moments that I would keep. I would not preserve the husk of life, but the kernel.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, December 23, 1851</p>

<p>Be resolutely and faithfully what you are; be humbly what you aspire to be. Be sure you give men the best of your wares, though they be poor enough, and the gods will help you to lay up a better store for the future.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, January 24, 1841</p>

<p>I find that whatever hindrances may occur I write just about the same amount of truth in my Journal; for the record is more concentrated, and usually it is some very real and earnest life, after all, that interrupts. All flourishes are omitted. If I saw wood from morning to night, though I grieve that I could not observe the train of my thoughts during that time, yet, in the evening, the few scrannel lines which describe my day's occupations will make the creaking of the saw more musical than my freest fancies could have been. I find incessant labor with the hands, which engrosses the attention also, the best method to remove palaver out of one's style. One will not dance at his work who has wood to cut and cord before the night falls in the short days of winter; but every stroke will be husbanded, and ring soberly through the wood; and so will his lines ring and tell on the ear, when at evening he settles the accounts of the day. I have often been astonished at the force and precision of style to which busy laboring men, unpracticed in writing, easily attain when they are required to make the effort. It seems as if their sincerity and plainness were the main thing to be taught in schools &mdash; and yet not in the schools, but in the fields, in actual service, I should say. &mdash;Journal, January 5, 1842</p>

<p>But the winter was not given to us for no purpose. We must thaw its cold with our genialness. We are tasked to find out and appropriate all the nutriment it yields. If it is a cold and hard season, its fruit, no doubt, is the more concentrated and nutty. It took the cold and bleakness of November to ripen the walnut, but the human brain is the kernel which the winter itself matures. Not till then does its shell come off. The seasons were not made in vain. Because the fruits of the earth are already ripe, we are not to suppose that there is no fruit left for winter to ripen. It is for man the seasons and all their fruits exist. The winter was made to concentrate and harden and mature the kernel of his brain, to give tone and firmness and consistency to his thought. Then is the great harvest of the year, the harvest of thought.</p>
<p>&mdash;Journal, January 30, 1854</p>

<p>Everywhere snow, gathered into sloping drifts about the walls and fences, and, beneath the snow, the frozen ground, and men are compelled to deposit the summer's provision in burrows in the earth like the ground squirrel. Many creatures, daunted by the prospect, migrated in the fall, but man remains and walks over the frozen snow-crust and over the stiffened rivers and ponds, and draws now upon his summer stores. Life is reduced to its lowest terms. There is no home for you now, in this freezing wind, but in that shelter which you prepared in the summer. You steer straight across the fields to that in season. I can with difficulty tell when I am over the river. There is a similar crust over my heart.</p>

<blockquote>
A cold and searching wind drives away all contagion, and nothing can withstand it but what has a virtue in it, and accordingly, whatever we meet with in cold and bleak places, as the tops of mountains, we respect for a sort of sturdy innocence, a Puritan toughness. All things beside seem to be called in for shelter, and what stays out must be part of the original frame of the universe, and of such valor as God himself. It is invigorating to breathe the cleansed air. Its greater fineness and purity are visible to the eye, and we would fain stay out long and late, that the gales may sigh through us, too, as through the leafless trees, and fit us for the winter,—as if we hoped so to borrow some pure and steadfast virtue, which will stead us in all seasons. -- A Winter Walk

<blockquote>March fans it, April christens it, and May puts on its jacket and trousers. It never grows up, but Alexandrian-like "drags its slow length along," ever springing, bud following close upon leaf, and when winter comes it is not annihilated, but creeps on mole-like under the snow, showing its face nevertheless occasionally by fuming springs and watercourses. So let it be with man &mdash; let his manhood be a more advanced and still advancing youth, bud following hard upon leaf. (Journal, March 1, 1838)</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the crimson colors of the west I discern the budding hues of dawn. To my western brother it is rising pure and bright as it did to me, but the evening exhibits in the still rear of the day the beauty which through morning and noon escaped me. (Journal, July 3, 1840)</blockquote>

<blockquote>I have no more distinctness or pointedness in my yearnings than an expanding bud, which does indeed point to flower and fruit, to summer and autumn, but is aware of the warm sun and spring influence only. I feel ripe for something, yet do nothing, can't discover what that thing is. I feel fertile merely. It is seedtime with me. I have lain fallow long enough. (Journal, November 17, 1850)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Pulling up the johnswort on the face of the Cliff, I am surprised to see the signs of unceasing growth about the roots &mdash; fresh shoots two inches long, white with red leaflets, and all the radical part quite green. The leaves of the crowfoot, also, are quite green, and carry me forward to spring. I dig one up with a stick, and, pulling it to pieces, I find deep in the centre of the plant, just beneath the ground, surrounded by all the tender leaves that are about to precede it, the blossom-bud, about half as big as the head of a pin, perfectly white. There it patiently sits, or slumbers, how full of faith, informed of a spring which the world has never seen, the promise and prophecy of it shaped somewhat like some Eastern temples, in which a bud-shaped dome o'ertops the whole. It affected me, this tender dome-like bud, within the bosom of the earth, like a temple upon the earth, resounding with the worship of votaries. Methought I saw the flamens in yellow robes within it. The crowfoot buds &mdash; and how many beside! &mdash; lie unexpanded just beneath the surface. May I lead my life the following year as innocently as they! May it be as fair and smell as sweet! I anticipate nature. (Journal, January 9, 1853)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Our work should be fitted to and lead on the time, as bud, flower, and fruit lead the circle of the seasons. (Journal, February 17, 1841)</blockquote>

<h3>1. Farm (February 7)</h3>

<p>I rose above my common hours to go in search of Thoreau's farm: not the lowland farm out at Walden Pond where he made the soil say beans, but the upland farm of his inner life where he made his soul say being.</p>
<p>Thoreau hid the approach to his upland farm behind a thicket of symbols and images. Thus we must laboriously seek the meaning of each fragrant word and significant line in his voluminous writings, conjecturing a larger sense than the common uses to which he is so often put: the hermit, the gadfly, the political activist, the environmentalist, the advocate for voluntary simplicity. Although he was all these things at times, they do not explain him.</p>
<p>The essence of his quest was to pursue some absorbing employment on the higher ground of his soul, to raise a crop that he could barter for heavenly products, to lay a foundation under the castle he had built in the air, to create a moral and intellectual domain over which he had firm possession.</p>
<p>As in the Bhagavat-Gita, the classic of Indian philosophy that he so treasured, in Thoreau's mind the great field to be cultivated is the self, and the greatest achievement is liberation through self-possession, self-control, and self-mastery. Because the English word "farm" refers to that over which one has firm possession and because the Sanskrit word "dharma" refers to that which is firmly established &mdash; that is, the right way of living &mdash; it turns out that the upland farmer is a cultivator of dharma!</p>
<p>Even though the upland farm is hard to find, Thoreau provided some clues regarding its location.</p>
<p>In Walden, he described how wisdom dictates simplicity of living, independence of mind, grandeur of soul, and trust in oneself &mdash; and he associated those virtues with winter, autumn, summer, and spring.</p>
<p>Living as he did in an agricultural society, he experienced the tensions between the seasons of nature and the seasons of human cultivation, and he knew that the ancient Roman writer Varro categorized the latter as preparing, planting, cultivating, harvesting, storing, and offering for sale.</p>
<p>His chosen profession of natural philosopher led him to spend countless hours and days observing the botanical stages of seed, sprout, tree, flower, fruit, leaf, and bud; thus he naturally likened those stages to the organic expression of human potential, which must be actively cultivated in order for one to reach fruition as an individual.</p>
<p>Blending these indications, we can see that perhaps the upland farm is located somewhere between a college town to the east (where one discovers self-trust in the springtime of one's life), a commercial city to the south (where one pursues grand summer designs of achievement and happiness), a farming community to the west (where one retires from more active affairs and engages in independent, autumnal reflection), and a wilderness area to the north (where one renounces worldly concerns and conducts a life of wintry simplicity).</p>
<p>Even after you find your upland farm, cultivating it is a deeply individual and often lonely pursuit. Not only narrow but rough is the way that leads to life everlasting; no broad and common road leads to the farm, only a footpath wide enough for one. There are no mechanical contrivances to be had; instead the upland farmer must work alongside nature while growing something even higher and better.</p>
<p>The harvest here is the rarest success: to achieve a balance between use and beauty, work and leisure, society and solitude, cooperation and independence, action and reflection, civilization and wildness, the real and the ideal, the practical and the transcendental &mdash; between the maintenance of your body and the maintenance of your soul.</p>
<p>To understand the aspirational experiments that Thoreau pursued at his upland farm, I have tapped the trees and boiled down the sweet sap of his books and essays, his poems and letters, and his vast journals; yet I have not stopped at syrup, but have gone on to procuring sugar from the new life that stirs in the roots and stems and leaves of his writings. These few pure crystals embody the transcendent idea that Thoreau pursued in all his works and days: the true poem of what he made of himself, the form and expression of his entire life, the highest use that he discovered and perfected in his independent existence.</p>

<h3>2. Seed (March 11)</h3>

<p>A seed is a small thing, almost invisible, hardly worth noticing. Yet it is a plant or tree in embryo; it has creative energy and the principle of life and growth within it.</p>
<p>Like the seed is the fruit. If you would eventually bear fruit of a divine flavor, you must pay close attention to learning the origins of your later seasons and to sowing such seeds as sincerity, truth, simplicity, faith, and innocence.</p>
<p>The simplest seed is awareness: awakening to life and its higher possibilities, seeking and finding personal liberation, attuning yourself with serenity and joy to the hope and expectation of greatness. This awareness is a morning invitation to simplicity and innocence, when you throw off the sleep of reason and elevate your life by conscious endeavor. Through a stern simplicity of life and elevation of purpose, you can make your life worthy of the contemplation of my most elevated and critical hour.</p>
<p>Just as bud follows hard upon leaf, so choice follows hard upon awareness. As an upland farmer, you reap what you sow and you must deliberately select the seeds of your liberation. The seed-time of your character shall produce nobler crops and better repay cultivation than the common stock, for only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence.</p>
<p>Thoreau likened a higher existence to a few particular plants and trees: the life-everlasting, the arbor vitae (tree of life), and the apples of the Hesperides &mdash; a mythical grove that could grant immortality to one who ate its golden fruit (parallel to the apples of the Norse goddess Iduna, which enabled the gods to stay ever-young).</p>
<p>In practice, choosing to cultivate crops of immortality meant, for Thoreau, living his idealism by hewing to a higher path, maintaining his individuality, keeping his own counsel, getting his living honestly, expecting of himself a nobler course of action in his daily existence. He had faith that these tiny seeds would eventually bear flowers and fruits of immortal beauty, and that, even if he never fully achieved his ideal, the benefits of idealism would accrue to him by producing an unconscious truthfulness and nobleness and beauty of life.</p>
<p>Thus are sown the seeds of a better life and a true success, steadying your pursuits and providing the foundation for a higher and more ethereal existence.</p>

<h3>3. Preparing (March 28)</h3>

<p>If the seeds of your life are to take root and thrive, you must first plan and prepare. Although Thoreau celebrated wildness, he recognized that the soul is not an unplowed meadow or an uncharted forest, but a garden or an orchard that requires constant tending.</p>
<p>So make ready: put on the pack of an upland farmer in good earnest. Know that the tools you can carry are few and small, but ancient and powerful. You must work with your hands, take advantage of what nature offers, and rely ultimately on yourself.</p>
<p>And keep your tools sharp: a spade for placing your seedlings down below the mud and slush of opinion and prejudice and tradition and appearance; a hoe for weeding out the many and inevitable distractions of life in modern society; an axe for pruning back the fast-growing branches of your desires and thus for living more simply; a pail for meting out the water of attention onto what truly matters.</p>
<p>The upland farmer also requires more rarified skills and aptitudes: mindful attention and being forever on the alert; sincerity and honesty in your dealings with yourself, and a critical eye to perceive whether you are ripe or rotten; calm patience and unwearied persistence and a sturdy discipline; and an endless curiosity about all the varied phenomena of life.</p>
<p>The transcendentalists such as Thoreau used these tools in applying the methods of living they valued most: self-knowledge and contemplation, studious reading in all the great traditions of human thought, and keen observation of nature and society.</p>
<p>Thus does the upland farmer prepare to ply his trade.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>4. Sprout (April 19)</h3>

<p>Late in life, while performing research into forest ecology, Thoreau noticed that trees which shoot up from stumps or roots are not as vigorous as those which begin in seeds; the shoots inherit the diseases of their parents, whereas the seedlings are thoroughly original and have an organic resilience and elasticity.</p>
<p>Thus the importance, for Thoreau, of growing your own roots and of listening to the faintest but constant suggestions of your own genius. Not for him the grafting of parent stock and the repetition of old errors; instead he preferred to grow resolutely wild and faithful to his own nature, to seek new adventures, to make new discoveries, to try new experiments in living and doing, to have the enterprise and faith to live free.</p>
<p>So also he approached the year, welcoming the hope and promise of spring, feeling his prospects brightened by the influx of better thoughts, nurturing some innocent fair shoots that would try another year's life &mdash; tender and fresh as the youngest plant.</p>
<p>So too he approached each day, awakening in an atmosphere of divine dreams, rising free from care before the dawn, blessing his whole day with a morning walk, returning again and again to goodness and simplicity, taking pleasure in the most glorious season of the day. As the sun rose he said to himself: "Let us be faithful all round; we will do justice and receive it."</p>
<p>At the lowland farm there are raised beds and greenhouses to protect your seedlings from exposure to excessive rains and late frosts; yet at the upland farm it is not so easy to dodge the pressures of conformity and to maintain your own recovered innocence. It takes a true strength of spirit to spring up and forward with vigor and energy and hope in the future.</p>
<p>For Thoreau, the true harvest of your daily life is to explore your own higher latitudes: the upper regions of thought, the continents and seas of the moral world, the private sea of one's being alone. He turned his back on wealth and power and success so that he could be the lord of a celestial empire within him. Although he felt sympathy with all living things, his greatest sympathy was with the spirit that animated his own clay and his greatest obedience was to yet more sacred laws and to the laws of his own being.</p>
<p>The germ and kernel of what you will leave behind in the autumn of your life or year or day is to be found in the leaves that sprout in the earliest spring, when the sap runs in your limbs and life buds in your furthest extremities. The impulse and the impetus of your life is found in each moment, for to affect the quality of the day is the highest of arts; and it is through the never-ending accumulation of moments that you feed the countless rootlets forming the foundation of your higher being. Blessed are those who live in the present always, for they remember their creator in the days of their youth and ever see the world with youthful, early-opened, hopeful eyes.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>5. Planting (May 6)</h3>

<p>It sounds so easy to follow your genius and obey the spur of the moment. Yet Thoreau recognized that there is a great and deep self-discipline here.</p>
<p>To plant is to found, to provide with a grounding in the bedrock realities and necessities of life. This is a natural foundation, not a conventional life merely but a human grounding in the very humus of the earth. The seed may fly freely on the slightest wind, but to become a mighty tree the seedling must become deeply rooted.</p>
<p>Thoreau believed that castles deserve to be built in the air, like the eyrie of an eagle that serves as a jumping-off point for this noble bird to sport with proud self-reliance in the fields of the sky. Yet this castle needs a foundation &mdash; and what better foundation for such great-hearted pursuits than the topmost branches of a lofty tree such as the tree of life itself?</p>
<p>To gain strength for this greatest flourishing, you must select and establish the core aspects of your way of life &mdash; where you live, how you live, with whom you live &mdash; and settle into those choices. By drawing sustenance from the air and sun and soil that surround you, you build the first roots and tender growth of your essence and identity, achieving solidity and structure through a morning faith and trust in the future.</p>
<p>It is one thing to speak of advancing confidently in the direction of your dreams and endeavoring to live the life you have imagined; it is quite another to figure out how to do so. Thoreau always maintained that the right path to a higher life can be found in a life that is outwardly simply but inwardly complex: in pruning back your desires, weeding out distractions, attending to what truly matters, and living earnestly. Life, he knew, is a serious business &mdash; the kind of private business he transacted at Walden Pond &mdash; and the upland farmer will strain every fiber of his moral and intellectual capacity to live simply and earnestly, and to attain the right object of living.</p>
<p>Cultivating the upland farm is thus in large measure a matter of refraining from what is unimportant: of knowing what is absolutely necessary for your highest growth and focusing your energies where they truly count. Yoking yourself to this kind of self-restraint, self-mastery, and self-discipline is essentially similar to the yogic practices of the ancient Indian philosophers Thoreau so admired, for he said that at times even he was a yogin. Yet this discipline is not imposed from without &mdash; it is a higher law nurtured inside, turned over and over in the receptive soil of your essential being, coming near to making a new world within.</p>
<p>This discipline of securing the most from life starts from what you have: improving from day to day the soil beneath your feet, harvesting whatever crop your life already yields, taking care to watch closely over the fruit of your thoughts and experience. When you do not strain to reach a fruit that is too far beyond your grasp, slowly you shoot upward with ever-expanding confidence; in the same proportion that you root yourself firmly in the earth, so also you rise into the heavens above and bear a nobler fruit at last in the air and light, far from the ground.</p>
<p>The everyday work of the soul requires a great pile of doing to gain a small diameter of being. One truly experienced moment of life requires countless hours of preparation toward the highest, most elevating goals we know.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>6. Tree (May 20)</h3>

<p>In the perfect days of late spring and early adulthood, you engage in your first, urgent growth toward your ideals: rooting downward, branching upward, leafing outward.</p>
<p>By focusing on the root and radicle of your existence, you burrow down below the mere surface of things and ally yourself with human nature and the humus of the earth.</p>
<p>By maintaining a scrupulous honesty with yourself, the stem of your identity becomes solid and steadfast.</p>
<p>By pursuing your highest, greenest potential, you increase the genial heat of what you will leave behind later in life and thus provide a benevolent shade to those beneath you.</p>
<p>In these three ways does your spirit unfold, representing an expansion of the ideal into the actual. You achieve a depth of understanding, a height of character, and a breadth of creativity. You find an an abundance of life and health, an everlasting vigor and serenity, and an expectation of perpetual untarnished morning. You embrace your fate and, instead of experiencing suffering or indifference, your enjoy and bless your existence, and the day and the night are such that you greet them with joy.</p>
<p>The true, living poetry of your life is like this tree, whose leaves precede the flower and fruit. It is what you become through your work, and how your ideals achieve form and expression in what you leave behind every day and year of your life.</p>
<p>Yet this spring growth into a more rarified air is often checked by the disappointments of experience. Some blast of residual cold threatens the kernel of your life from ripening. The challenge is to not allow such a crisis to keep you from finding your second growth in the autumn of your life, from bearing your fruit at last, from doing the work that only you can do, from propagating intellectually and morally.</p>
<p>It is this that you achieve when you cultivate the tree which you have found to bear fruit in your soil. Although it is tempting to venture far away from your roots in order to achieve greatness, Thoreau counsels that you do not need to go not so far out of your way in order to lead a truer life. Instead, keep strictly onward in that path alone which your genius points out. Do the things which lie nearest to you, but which are difficult to do. Live a purer, a more thoughtful and laborious life, more true to your friends and neighbors, more noble and magnanimous. Thus do you track yourself through life, always on the trail of your deepest nature.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>7. Trust (May 28)</h3>

<p>For Thoreau, trust was primarily self-trust, and even more important than trusting yourself was to be worthy of trust. Ever on the alert for natural and linguistic connections, Thoreau was no doubt aware that trust, truth, troth, and tree share a common root. To be worthy of trust is to be as firm and straight as a tree, to be true to your nature, to be trothed to integrity, to be sincere in your dealings with yourself, to be loyal to a life of principle, to be obedient to higher laws.</p>
<p>These higher laws are the laws of your own being; they are not imposed from without, but deliberately chosen and obediently followed within. It is the license of your higher being to establish new laws around and within you &mdash; such laws as purity, chastity, and temperance. These laws much harder to live up to than the laws of men, and they point toward the possibility of a divine life. Even though a divine life is not open to mere mortals, you can capture some of that ethereal quality by practicing an inward and outward austerity, by letting your mind descend into your body and redeem it, by treating yourself with ever increasing respect. This is partly what Thoreau means by advancing confidently in the direction of your dreams and living the life you have imagined.</p>
<p>By fearlessly living out your own essential nature, you connect your life to the divine even if it is, in the end, unattainable. Few are those who contemplate their highest possibilities, who pursue some crowning experiences above and beyond those that the merely common laws might approve, who seek out a revolution in their own inner lives.</p>
<p>Devotion to the divine and cultivation of the right way of living require self-discipline and self-restraint. There are similarities here to the ancient Vedantic concept of <em>brahmacharya</em> or studenthood, the first phase of life in which one dedicates oneself to deep learning and simple living.</p>
<p>Growing up as it does in the nurturing environment of youth, self-trust might seem opposed to a mature independence. As hinted, perhaps a balance can be found here by imagining the upland farm as located between a college town to the east and a farming community to the west. To find the right away of living, even while building self-trust in one's youth one must also seek out opportunities for reflection and for thinking independently of one's family, one's teachers, and one's peers.</p>
<p>Self-trust builds on all the attainments of your early life: aspiration, awareness, deliberation, originality, discipline, steadfastness, integrity, sincerity. It is, as it were, the crown of the spring virtues, bursting forth with hope and confidence in the future, growing naturally alongside the emergence of self and your own firm identity.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>8. Flower (June 16)</h3>

<p>The root and stem and leaves &mdash; your depth and uprightness and benevolence, and the self-trust that grows from them &mdash; provide the beginnings of a beautiful and winged life that fulfills great expectations and that is a blessing to mankind. Thoreau challenges you to a goodness that is not a partial and transitory act, but a complete and constant superfluity; when you flow and flower in courage and health and ease, your life gives off a fragrance that is not merely useful, but an unconscious nobleness and truthfulness of character and life that grows gradually from within outward, that inspires those around you, that enhances the general sweetness of the atmosophere, that enriches the world with your visions and joys.</p>
<p>The beauty and purity of which he speaks comprise the uncompromising principles and consistent self-control that enable you to achieve nobility and magnanimity, to produce works of unsurpassing value, to pluck every flower of thought, to prove every sentiment it is possible to experience. The great task of existence is to get the most life, to extract honey from the flower of the world. Thoreau urges you to make <em>that</em> your every-day business, and to be busy as a bee about it &mdash; to be, indeed, both the flower and the bee, both the creator of a perfect summer life and its most industrious gatherer. It is the greatest success to live so that only the most beautiful wild-flowers will spring up where you have dwelt.</p>
<p>To bloom and flourish so exquisitely, you must transcend and translate yourself, as does the caterpillar that metamorphoses into a butterfly. Consider the famous dream of Taoist philosopher Chuang Tzu, in which he wondered how he could distinguish whether he was Chuang Tzu dreaming that he was a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming that he was Chuang Tzu. In "Higher Laws" Thoreau speculates that the answer is perhaps you can be both, by preserving your higher or poetic faculties in the best condition, and by rising above a merely physical, grubbing existence to a perfect state of being in which you fly freely and happily, sipping the sweetest and most ethereal forms of sustenenace while at the same time spreading pollen from flower to flower and thus creating your higher self.</p>
<p>This metamorphosis and living up to your highest potential is inspired most of all by love and by friendship. In love we impart the best of ourselves and alone perceive the truest fragrance of the beloved. In friendship can be found the highest fruit which the year may bear, and which lends its fragrance to life. This essential fragrance is the best of ourselves, the ripe thoughts and atmosphere that comprise the crop of crops and that refresh and encourage us not for a moment but for a lifetime. Thoreau found such inspiration in his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson (despite the eventual and perhaps inevitable cooling of their relationship), in Ellen Sewell (to whom he unsuccessfully proposed marriage but whom he still professed to love in the last months of his life), in his brother John and sister Sophia, and in his other close family and friends. Even though Thoreau never married or had children, in many ways he still realized the ancient Indian ideal of <em>grihastha</em> by actively upholding not only his family's household but also for a number of years that of his friend Emerson; and these responsibilities reinforced his highest ambitions.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>9. Cultivating (July 12)</h3>

<p>The upland farm requires active care and intentional guidance, for the tree of life needs water and sunlight and air and space to grow.</p>
<p>Water is like attention: by lavishing attention on what is important, I ensure that I focus on what truly matters. No method nor discipline can supersede the necessity of being forever on the alert, even or especially with regard to myself, for self-deception is the easiest thing in the world.</p>
<p>Sunlight is like knowledge, especially self-knowledge: by understanding what is possible to me, I live more earnestly and I receive enlightenment with trust and magnanimity. Although it is true that the sun shines equally upon the lowland farm and the upland farm, the upland light is more regular and pure, since it is unobstructed by the mists and fogs common to the lowlands.</p>
<p>Air is like freedom, for upland air makes free: by pruning back my fears and desires, I leave myself more room for higher pursuits and nurture superior virtues within myself.</p>
<p>Space is like solitude: by forming an intimate aquaintance with the weeds that grow in the soil of my life and the vices that grow in my soul, I am more able to pull them up and thus pursue experiences of significance and opportunities for personal growth.</p>
<p>Cultivating attention and self-knowledge and freedom and solitude is in large measure the regular work I engage in to hone my being and nurture each day a still fresher soul within me. For the soul has a certain magnetism in it, which attracts the power or virtue that gives it life, and which is the reason for all the labor I expend to sustain it. The finest tools I can wield are imagination and reason and belief, which enable a new creation and pasturage of thought within me - the most solid wealth and the most real estate of my living on earth. This is the highest discipline and truest work of the soul, a kind of <em>karma yoga</em> on the great field of the self. The motive of one who toils in this field of a wholly new life is do this work well, for the love of the work alone.</p>
<p>Yet, although Thoreau calls me to do some work every day to show for my ecstasy or despondency, at Walden Pond sometimes he spent the entire morning in contemplation, forsaking works entirely. Even then, however, the day advanced as if to shed light on some work of his. Was there not a tension in his life between the hardworking poet-naturalist (who authored perhaps 10,000 pages) and the town idler who never held a steady job? He counseled: "Do your work, and finish it. If you know how to begin, you will know when to end." Before sunrise and long after sunset he was studying at his desk or in the woods, and the result was a singular cheerfulness. He was always busy about learning the trade of life, working out a true life for himself - an effort that requires more art and delicate skill than any other work. Instead of turning out silver by the cartload, he preferred to mine the true, interior gold that was known only to him high up on the uplands of his life - to cultivate the noblest of crops and to get the most honest living he could.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>10. Magnanimity (August 6)</h3>

<p>Ever attuned to the course of the seasons, Thoreau was keenly aware of the longer and cooler nights of August, when the year starts to descend the long slope toward winter. A new urgency accompanies this afternoon of the year: no longer can you afford to postpone the fulfillment of your hopes in a future and anticipated nobleness, but it is past time to pursue a true life and to take courage in reaching for high flourishing, noble ambition, riotous growth, overflowing life, and a faster progression toward one's ideal.</p>
<p>Thoreau called this magnanimity, in its ancient sense of grandeur of soul. He knew that the anima is the vital spirit: that which forms the basis for character and personality, that which enables you to grow outward from within. To be great hearted and high minded is to give no thought and have no need for mere ornament, but to achieve an unconscious nobleness and truthfulness of character and life, to accept an invitation to be what you are, which is something noble and worthy. The upland farm will produce nobler crops, and better repay cultivation in the long run.</p>
<p>The great challenge, in the afternoon of life, is to keep up an atmosphere of perpetual morning and the great expectations of your youth, to try what noble life you can, to reinvigorate and morally reform the very medium of your existence, to maintain your life with dignity and sincerity, to burst the bonds of despair and realize the full grandeur of your destiny, to find elevation in every hour, to exercise your highest human faculties, to make your life, even in its details, worthy of the contemplation of your most elevated and critical hour. It is to advance into the career of life with the equanimity of nature, silent and patient and unpretending; to move onward through your midday with earnest toil and a lofty and serene countenance; to get ready, through the accumulated deed of the day, a rich western blaze against the evening of your life - in short, it is to have a fresh dawn, and a great noon, and a serene sunset in yourself.</p>
<p>In the summertime of life and the royal month of August you spend your greatest life energy in an outdoor life that is all for action. Yet Thoreau counsels that there is no need to venture far from the core and heart of your life in some frontier country: instead cultivate the field on which you find yourself, and do the things that lie nearest to you but that are difficult to do. It is more than enough to breathe your self, to give voice to a free life and free expression without bounds, to rise above sects and parties. The essence of your person can be found in your best thoughts; by honoring this, you honor the freedom to think sacredly and create devotedly - a freedom from fear, from perturbation, from prejudice. When you honor the immutable laws of integrity and magnanimity, you hold to an inward light that makes you able to appreciate what noble deeds are done by your compatriots on this earth.</p>
<p>Thoreau went to Walden Pond to transact some private business, and to do so greatly and unhurriedly. He avowed that when you are unhurried and wise, your perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence, that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of reality, and that your proper pursuit and high calling is to root yourself firmly in the earth only so that you can in the same proportion rise into the heavens above. When you do so, you live in relations of truth and sincerity: a purer, more thoughtful and laborious life, more true to your friends and neighbors, more noble and magnanimous.</p>
<p>This active pursuit of a noble life is the seeming opposite of the simplicity that Thoreau so cherished. Yet in the end it is congruent with his acceptance and knowledge of the seasons. The cycles of work and rest, growth and harvest, are just as natural to the day and the year of the individual as they are to Nature herself. No one part of the cycle of life provides complete fulfillment; and if in the summer of life you approach the upland farm from a commercial town to the south, bustling with activity and ambition, this provides but one direction and path to a higher life.</p>

<h3>11. Fruit (September 2)</h3>

<p>Having adventured on life in the high summer, having sent your shoot upward with confidence, it remains to mature and ripen and come to your growth and fruition, for the nobler plants are valued for the fruit they bear at last in the air and light, far from the ground.</li>
<p>For Thoreau, the higher life is not a delicious but ephemeral springtime fruit like the strawberry, but a lasting food that is hardened by the sun of summer and the coolness of autumn.</p>
<p>To be ripe is to be perfected and to serve a transcendent use - not a means to a higher end, but an end in yourself, such as the transcendent use of Thoreau's great hero John Brown. It is to have some spare capital and superfluous vigor in respect to your spirit and imagination, a true wealth and independence, a free and adventurous spirit, a reserve of elasticity and strength, and a spirit that transmutes your whole life into purity and devotion to your highest ideals. It is when everything about you is ripe and glows with maturity from root to stem to leaves, when you are no longer dependent on your transient moods, when all your experience ripens into wisdom, when everything you have been and have done in the spring and summer of your life bears its fruit at last.</p>
<p>This fruit is the successful realization of your highest potential, your true nature, your inner seed. It is to be well employed as an individual. In Walden, Thoreau is careful to note that he does not speak to those who are well employed, in whatever circumstances they find themselves, if they know whether or not they are well employed.</p>
<p>But there's the challenge: how do you test yourself for ripeness and know whether you are making full use and enjoyment of the finest qualities of your nature, whether you are maturing your finer fruits, whether you are addressing the taste for ethical beauty?</p>
<p>One clue is whether you are living simply and wisely, whether you have a serious eye and a sincere life. Your proper and finer work is a true integrity day to day, and too often you are prevented from doing this work by a lack of moderation and self-control, occupied as you are with trivial concerns and coarse labors. Your highest fruit is not your economic use - for most people exaggerate the importance of the work they do - but a more spiritual employment and a set of more essential, ethereal qualities: transparent character, constant superfluity, and simple humanity. It is a matter not of having something to do, but something to be. The ambrosial and essential part of the fruit, its true flavor, is imparted only to the one who raises and plucks that fruit for its own sake - for it is too pure to have a purely market value.</p>
<p>Another clue is whether you are plucking the celestial fruit, the golden apple of the Hesperides, which is the apple of the tree of self-knowledge. Is your primary trade with the celestial empire that produces this celestial fruit? This trade requires strict business habits and labors that task your highest human faculties: persistence, strength, enterprise, bravery, serenity, alertness, adventurousness, confidence, and courage to know that you know what you know, and that you do not know what you do not know. It is needful to test yourself and observe yourself closely, with as much honesty and sincerity as you can muster, in order to know whether you are truly ripe, whether your inward verdure is that of a wholly new life..</p>
<p>The fruit of these efforts tastes all the sweeter and more palatable for the very difficulties you have contended with.</li>

<h3>12. Harvesting (September 18)</h3>

<p>The ripening of existence, the late and perfect maturity of experience, yields a certain mellowness and stronger flavor to life. It is time to harvest your ripened fruits, to reap what you have sowed, to pluck the days and works of your achievements, to appreciate the beauty of your life with an Indian-summer serenity.</p>
<p>The true harvest of your daily life is, like the most subtle tints of morning and evening, a gratitude for existence, a simple and irrepressible satisfaction with the gift of life - like a calm September afternoon in which the surface of a woodland lake is as smooth as glass. This is the pure liquid joy of a serene happiness, not animated by the thrills of an agitated joy or frenzied delight, but a wonderful purity attained by being reserved and austere, living with gentleness and a humble gratitude for the fruit of character that feeds you or the tree of life that shadows you, practicing justice and innocence and a greater humanity.</p>
<p>This is a gratitude not for rest only, but also for toil; a harvest not only of the sweetest fruits, but also of the scarlet leaves of the thoughts and acts that you planted in the seed-time of your character and that have acquired consistency and hardness as well as a concentrated flavor and a mellow ripeness. You must gather that rich crop of experience which your life yields and to confidently and heartily live up to your ideals (for if you are in error you learn, and if not you progress).</p>
<p>Do not spend your time atoning for the neglect of past opportunities, but even in the evening of your works and days allow your prospect to brighten on the influx of better thoughts and a rejuvenescence and faith in the current time. Daily recover your innocence through serene work in the true field of life and self. Live in the present with a pure morning joy, for this season, too, is a season of growth, a second spring.</p>
<p>Launch yourself on every wave. Find your eternity in each moment. Know what game to play today, and play it. Postpone no opportunities. Look not to some other land; for there is no other land, no other life. Take any other course, and life will be a succession of regrets. Harvest as early as possible if you would escape the frosts.</p>
<p>If you are not happy on harvest day, you will not be so tomorrow. And is not every day a harvest day?</p>

If you are not cramped by spiritual debts, you have the freedom to spend your time and energy as you see fit, and to enjoy the gift of life and taste its true flavor.</li>
<li>A heroic spirit that dreams of remoter retirements and more rugged paths, that is wise and ready to live a self-reliant and independent existence.</li>
<li>Whereas cultivated fruits depend altogether on our care and planting, wild apples emulate human independence and enterprise.</li>
<li>Simple, honest, independent labor frees you from all enervating luxuries.</li>

<h3>14. Leaf (October 17)</h3>

<ul>
<li>theme: reflection</li>
<li>"what is peeled or stripped off"</li>
<li>what you leave behind</li>
<li>spiritual inheritance </li>
<li>Iliad quote</li>
<li>Autumnal Tints</li>
<li>in practice, how to turn the slough and dross of my experience into humus that enriches the soil for growth? among other things, learning from mistakes (my own and others'). But there is also value in learning from <em>successes</em>.</li>
<li>each day and year brings new "leavings" and new opportunities for learning</li>
<li>several methods here: reading, biography, friendship, family, social observation</li>
<li>humus/homo = earth/man</li>
<li>the vibrant color and beauty of autumnal tints; being a "sugar maple man" in the fall, too</li>
<li>"reading of another's experience"</li>
<li>"the earth expresses itself outwardly in leaves"</li>
<li>"the change to some higher color in a leaf is an evidence that it has arrived at a late and perfect maturity"</li>
<li>benevolence, superfluity, unconscious philanthropy</li>
<li>soil is like inner strength; I nourish the roots of my being with a natural fertilizer formed of the slough and dross of my experience and learning (cf. Thoreau on leaves)</li>
<li>To lie down and take leave of life as gracefully as the leaves do.</li>
<li>Doing what we do best or most perfectly, what we have most thoroughly learned by the longest practice, what has grown organically from seeds planted early in life. Such actions falls from us unconsciously, as the leaf falls from the tree. Flow. Superfluity.</li>
<li>To leave behind a poem (i.e., the life you have lived) in which future generations can delight, as a mould that nourishes the future tree of life.</li>
<li>The leaf, having been perfected, leaves the tree and has its own independent existence. The action, having been perfected, leaves the self and has its own independent existence. The poem of life as an independent creation. The true poem of life what you have become through your work, through the pursuit of your highest use - how the idea obtains form and expression in your own life.</li>
<li>Yet even afterward the stem, too, ripens, especially the young twigs, which experience a secong spring of shooting growth.</li>
<li>A ripe old age in which one is ready to  be reaped.</li>
<li>In the economy of Nature, nothing is wasted, everything is put to use, every decayed leaf and twig and fibre serves as compost for future growth.</li>
<li>A successful life is a complete maturity, a ripening from leaf to root - when your entire being blooms as one flower - when you finish your summer's work, ripen your seeds, rejoice in your existence, experience unalloyed reflections, faithfully discharge your duties, neglect none of your economies, add to your stature in human virtue, grow steadily toward heaven all your life, and deserve well of humanity.</li>
<li>An Indian summer of finer atmosphere of pensive beauty. As in Walden, a time of Oriental contemplation, of springlike faith and serene confidence.</li>
<li>An anticipation of spring, an evidence of warmth and genialness, a preparation for passing from this life into another.</li>
<li>Experiencing pure and distinct reflections, and thoughts that are a foretaste of the spring.</li>
</ul>

<h3>15. Storing (November 17)</h3>

<p>On cold November days, I provide for coming dormancy by cultivating a renewed focus on the essentials of life. I put things on a winter footing and find a certain broad pause and opportunity to start again, to turn over a new leaf even after the few remaining leaves of summer have come fluttering down.</p>
<p>Yet the prospect of winter does not lead to a bleak and cheerless resignation, because the true harvest of the day, of the year, of life is to be found not in the sweet, ripe fruit which it yields, but in the concentrated, nutty kernel of thought which it occasions. This is a matter not of plucking each fruit as it passes, but of gathering a rich crop of experience and growth, cheerfully threshing the grain and separating the kernel from the chaff, picking over the choicest specimens of what I am and aspire to be, and storing these safely in my bin.</p>
<p>By making a faithful record of my strivings and learnings, the things I love, my affection for any aspect of the world, and what I love to think of, I store it for future use and can restore it again at will through the faculty of imagination. The reminiscence affects me as poetry and enables me to appreciate that other season of life, that ripe and mellow moment, that experience and mood. Thus only the rarest flower, the purest melody, of the season comes down to me. The world so seen is all one spring, full of beauty.</p>
<p>It is never too late to slough off my errors and give up my prejudices, to insist upon proof for my ways of thinking and doing, to purify myself of the dross and earthiness which I have accumulated during my works and days.</p>
<p>I aspire to practice in succession all the honest arts of life, and late in the day the best of these is sincere and searing reflection: to settle my accounts, to admit whether or not I have lived deliberately and have been well employed, to give tone and firmness and consistency to my thought and my actions. And if in my most elevated and critical house I find my life unworthy, let not my experience wear upon me, but, encouraged, let me set out again to climb the mountain of the earth and seek a future is worth expecting.</p>
<p>However, this discipline of self-knowledge is, like the jñāna yoga of the Vedas, not a matter of constraint and severity. Thoreau may have been a sort of natural Stoic, but his was a cheerful wisdom. He learned to live, to make few apologies: "Be resolutely and faithfully what you are; be humbly what you aspire to be."</p>

<hr/>

<h3>16. Simplicity (December 7)</h3>
<ul>
<li>"something with one fold"</li>
<li>an unfolding of oneself</li>
<li>also ply = to use, wield, practice consistently or diligently</li>
<li>ply a single heavenly trade</li>
<li>focus on essentials </li>
<li>"that economy of living which is synonymous with philosophy"</li>
<li>not for the sake of simplicity itself, but clearing the ground for something higher</li>
<li>crown of the winter virtues</li>
<li>describe other winter virtues as well</li>
<li>influence of Stoics and Hinduism</li>
<li>dispersion of seeds </li>
<li>dormancy in all its meanings</li>
<li>existence is stripped to its essentials and simplest elements</li>
<li>essential simplicity as having few wants, having true needs, also being earnest and sincere</li>
<li>"The wonderful purity of nature at this season is a most pleasing fact."</li>
<li>"a perennial waveless serenity"</li>
<li>"inexpressible tenderness and fragile delicacy"</li>
<li>"cool and even temperament"</li>
<li>"Heaven is under our feet is well as over our heads."</li>
<li>Find spiritual wealth through simplicity and naturalness: sweep away the superfluous, focus on the essential laws of existence, and take what nature has to give you.</li>
<li>Give the best of your wares, a very real and earnest life, a sincerity and plainness in how you live.</li>
<li>Only those can withstand the cold and searching winds of December who have a pure and steadfast virtue, a sturdy innocence, a Puritan toughness, and such valor as God himself - those who live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that is not life.</li>
<li>Unless you do more than simply learn the trade of your time, you are but a skillful apprentice, and not yet a master workman of the art of life.</li>
<li>Men do not fail commonly for want of knowledge, but for want of prudence to give wisdom the preference. What we need to know in any case is very simple.</li>
<li>Do not play life, or study it merely, but earnestly live it from beginning to end. How better learn to live than by at once trying the experiment of living? Actively educate yourself in that economy of living which is synonymous with philosophy, instead of merely professing.</li>
<li>To simplify the problem of life, it is necessary to distinguish the necessary and the real. Turn away from superficial and trivial desires toward aspirations for a better character and a higher, nobler life.</li>
<li>A rigid economy, a stern and more than Spartan simplicity of life, an honesty and elevation of purpose. Let your affairs be as two or three, not a hundred or a thousand. Life is frittered away on details, ruined by luxury and heedless expense.</li>
<li>Attending to trivial things (routines, conventions, manners, and the like) dissipates and impoverishes the mind and robs it of strength and simplicity.</li>
<li>The highest development and employment is simplicity through wisdom and the cultivation of the highest faculties. If you spend all your time working for common luxuries and outward refinements, or even for knowledge and culture as conventionally defined, you have no time to experience profound thoughts and inward complexity. The former is a voluntary enslavement, the latter an essential freedom.</li>
<li>Invest in your higher self and let your capital be simplicity, serenity, and contentment.</li>
<li>"It is the greatest of all advantages to enjoy no advantage at all."</li>
<li>This seeming poverty, this simplification of lifestyle and paucity of experiences, this withdrawal from human society and worldly concerns, is in fact a concentration of strength and energy and flavor that fits me for spiritual abundance and a higher society - the sweet friendship of the seasons, the most innocent and divinely encouraging society in every natural object and in universal nature.</li>
<li>When, as in the Laws of Manu, the questions to be decided are as simple as how to eat and drink and sleep, then we realize that our natural wants are easily and gracefully satisfied.</li>
<li>A simple, wholesome, true relation to nature grants us health and happiness and inspiration and a hundred other far finer and nobler fruits than the mere products of human enterprise.</li>
<li>The active business of life furnishes nothing on which the eye of reason can rest.</li>
<li>Our serene moments are simply a transient realization of what might be the whole tenor of our lives.</li>
<li>"Sometimes we are clarified and calmed healthily, as we never were before in our lives, not by an opiate, but by some unconscious obedience to the all-just laws so that we become like a still lake of purest crystal and without an effort our depths are revealed to ourselves."</li>
<li>It is well to find my employment and amusement in simple and homely things, to derive my satisfactions and inspirations from the most common events and everyday phenomena, so that I may dream of no heaven but that which lies about me.</li>
<li>The purpose of living simply is not simplification, but clearing the ground so that you may live more worthily and profitably. This is the sweetest fruit; and after one taste of it you will immediately learn to economize most skillfully.</li>
<li>Most people satisfy their wants in a complicated, indirect, artificial way; trading their time for money and their money for the goods they need, they postpone instant life and miss out on the inexpressible joy that is the reward of satisfying their wants simply, directly, and truly. The true arts of life &mdash; such as growing and cooking one's food, building and maintaining one's shelter, making one's tools, and conveying oneself under one's own power, and, when temperately pursued, getting the means of one's living &mdash; are simultaneously one's work and one's highest pleasure.</li>
<li>The pleasure and warmth is not so much in having as in a true and simple manner getting the necessities of life through simple, honest, independent labor.</li>
<li>seeming opposite of magnanimity?</li>
<li>approaching the upland farm from a wilderness to the north (winter / renunciation / sannyasa)</li>

<h3>17. Bud (December 22)</h3>
<ul>
<li>theme: innocence / hope</li>
<li>"swelling", "extension"</li>
<li>a swelling or extension of this season into the next</li>
<li>continuity of life</li>
<li>a recognition of the possibilities for tomorrow, next year, even the future of humanity</li>
<li>a time of being pregnant with possibilities</li>
<li>a resting bud, formed in preparation for the next season of growth</li>
<li>hope and eternal youth</li>
<li>part of one's work is to form the buds for the next season of growth (and, at the end of life, an offering to those who come after)</li>
<li>the next season of growth could be posthumous - did Thoreau believe in transmigration or merely the eternal fame of the writer?</li>
<li>the buds and hidden shoots of winter</li>
<li>being ever green and full of sap</li>
<li>second spring</li>
<li>daily and yearly practice here: knowing what remains to be done in order to achieve one's ideals</li>
<li>end and beginning</li>
<li>to "keep a bright fire" within one's breast</li>
<li>"the year beginning with younger hope than ever"</li>
<li>"the symbol of perpetual youth"</li>
<li>"our human life but dies down to the root, and still puts forth its green blade to eternity"</li>
<li>innocence as a form of justice?</li>
<li>the achieved ideal of a wise innocence</li>
<li>discerning true from false, good from bad, necessary from frivolous, etc. - and living based on that knowledge</li>
<li>prep/plant/cultivate/harvest/store/offer model - how it applies to the structure of the day, of the year, and of life as a whole</li>
<li>bud / Buddha</li>
<li>Sanskrit budh and buddhi are unrelated etymologically but still of interest: budh = to be awake, aware, conscious, buddhi = the faculty that makes wisdom possible through discernment of truth from falsehood</li>
<li>connection to heroes of Bhagavad Gita: Yudhishthira (steadfastness, truthfulness, discipline / self-control, integrity, trust), Bhima (strength, courage, magnanimity, nobility), Nakula (love, wisdom, independence), Sahadeva (piety, spirituality, simplicity, justice) - with Arjuna representing focus, concentration, aiming for and hitting the target (cf Aristotle on hamartia) - see also Hadot on the present moment: this is the great point on which the wise man concentrates</li>
<li>The unexpanded bud patiently sleeps with faith in an unseen spring, yearning for an unceasing growth, a more advanced and still advancing youth.</li>
<li>Being confident and prepared for another year.</li>
<li>The brave spears of next year's buds do not succumb to melancholy or despair of life, but confidently shoot upward and forward to a future unfolding of character, when the living green blade reaches again for eternity.</li>
<li>1851-07-16: Despite all experience, a recovered innocence through the love of virtue and the pursuit of perfection. Constantly improving by removing the impurities of my soul. Constantly refining my life to fit myself for a finer society. In relation to virtue and innocence and what I could be, the bud is unexpanded and it is earliest spring with me.</li>
<li>1852-10-26: Despite being old in years, to be young in soul. Despite the jarrings of life, to be still and smooth within so that I may absorb the rays of the sun and reflect the beauty of both cultivated and uncultivated nature. To keep this freedom and peace in my mind. In the coldest and bleakest winter, to keep this summer virtue in my heart.</li>
<li>On the pensive shores of evening, the bud of imagination that is the final fruit of the day's work contains within itself the hope and expectation of a seed-time whose bright and immortal harvest cannot fail. This is the real purport of my toil, the true kernel of what I bear to fruition.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h3>18. Offering (January 24)</h3>
<ul>
<li>theme: faith / reverence</li>
<li>"presenting, giving, sacrificing" </li>
<li>offering oneself to what is highest</li>
<li>piety / faith / devotion / love / sharing</li>
<li>bhakti yoga - the discipline of devotion</li>
<li>to devote your life to the discovery of the divinity in nature and within yourself</li>
<li>dharma and eusebeia = spiritual maturity and a reverential attitude towards life</li>
<li>a beautiful life and a transparent character</li>
<li>a heavenly "market": to raise a crop which needs not to be brought down into the valley to a market; which you barter for heavenly products</li>
<li>there is a certain volatile and ethereal quality which represents your highest value, and is too pure to have a market value and which cannot be bought and sold (thus barter, not monetary trade); and it is a vulgar error to suppose that one can taste this higher flavor of life without having done the work of preparing, planting, cultivating, harvesting, and storing</li>
<li>yet one's final offering consists in the forsaking of works and the sacrificing in one's mind not only one's first but one's last fruits also</p>
<li>transcendence = "to climb above"</li>
<li>transcendent use</li>
<li>and not only use but enjoyment: the spirit with which you do something determines whether it is a truly fruitful experience and whether it contributes to your development as a human being</li>
<li>the richest gifts we can bestow are the least marketable</li>
<li>it is the rarest success to simultaneously support both your body and your essence; the harmony of work and life, which makes you all alive and gives your days an inexpressible satisfaction, a sense of elevation and expansion; thus the day and the night are such that you greet them with joy, and life emits a fragrance like flowers and sweet-scented herbs, is more elastic, more starry, more immortal</li>
<li>rebirth</li>
<li>ideals, and the interval between the ideal and the actual</li>
<li>the darkest hour, yet a celebration of light that will return</li>
<li>segue to new year and renewed life (even if not one's own)</li>
<li>to afford nourishment to new generations of your kind</li>
<li>also: the arc of your life might not be timed to the revolution of the seasons, so that your mortal existence is merely the spring of your spirit, and your spirit's unfolding might stretch for centuries afterward ... kleos</li>
<li>to spend as a producer is to become spent (Shaw quote)</li>
<li>so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates</li>
<li>living up to (and for?) one's ideal</li>
<li>treating one's life as an offering to what is best and highest - making one's life a sacrament, a dear and cherished object, which one constantly polishes and improves</li>
<li>no expectation of return (fruits), thus (in Vedanta) no attachment to things or people ... but is this true of Thoreau? he was devoted to his family, his friends, his place</li>
<li>a free offering of oneself, of one's work and energy (karma)</li>
<li>making peace, dying well</li>
<li>summation of life</li>
<li>private ecstasy above even the farm</li>
<li>the parable of the artist of Kouroo: life everlasting and perennial youth come from purity of one's self and one's works, and from singleness of purpose and resolution</li>
<li>love your life, meet it and live it; keep a quiet mind; live an independent life; support yourself by honest means; cultivate the soul by turning and returning to what you are; pursue magnanimity on a higher level; come to your bearing and let the times go by while you stand or sit thoughtfully on the side; weigh and settle and gravitate toward that which most strongly and rightfully attracts you; travel the path that only you can</li>
<li>dawn breaks and the sun rises, yet the springtime of the day merely presages the perfect summer life to which you can aspire in your highest hour, and which you can cultivate at your upland farm; man also rises to a beautiful and winged life, and I too can become what I am, having learned what that is</li>
<li>there are higher planes, infinitely higher planes, of life than this thou art travelling on. Know that the goal is distant, and is upward, and is worthy of all your life's efforts to attain to.</li>
<li>The old mythology is incomplete without a god or goddess of sincerity, on whose altars we might offer up all the products of our farms, our workshops, and our studies.... I mean sincerity in our dealings with ourselves mainly; any other is comparatively easy.</li>
<li>Be resolutely and faithfully what you are; be humbly what you aspire to be. Be sure you give men the best of your wares, though they be poor enough, and the gods will help you to lay up a better store for the future.</li>

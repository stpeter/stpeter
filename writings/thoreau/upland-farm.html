<h3>1. Site</h3>
<ul>
<li>site = "allow to be in a place"</li>
<li>allow yourself to be in a higher place</li>

<li>beauty and use, heaven and earth, ideal and real, the transcendental and the natural</li>
<li>individual (footpath)</li>
<li>no shortcuts or mechanical aids</li>
<li>pack of the upland farmer (few tools)</li>
<li>seed, sprout, flower, fruit, leaf, bud - natural expressions of one's human potential that must be actively cultivated</li>
<li>cultivation as working with nature, and the tension inherent there</li>
<li>Varro's seasons: preparing, planting, cultivating, harvesting, storing, offering for sale</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
Some absorbing employment on your higher ground,—your upland farm,—whither no cart-path leads, but where you mount alone with your hoe,—where the life everlasting grows; there you raise a crop which needs not to be brought down into the valley to a market; which you barter for heavenly products. -- Letter to Harrison Blake, May 28th, 1850
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
All the world complain nowadays of a press of trivial duties and engagements, which prevents their employing themselves on some higher ground they know of; but, undoubtedly, if they were made of the right stuff to work on that higher ground, provided they were released from all those engagements, they would now at once fulfill the superior engagement, and neglect all the rest, as naturally as they breathe. -- Letter to Harrison Blake, July 21st, 1852
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The problem of life becomes, one cannot say by how many degrees, more complicated as our material wealth is increased,—whether that needle they tell of was a gateway or not,—since the problem is not merely nor mainly to get life for our bodies, but by this or a similar discipline to get life for our souls; by cultivating the lowland farm on right principles, that is, with this view, to turn it into an upland farm. You have so many more talents to account for. If I accomplish as much more in spiritual work as I am richer in worldly goods, then I am just as worthy, or worth just as much, as I was before, and no more. I see that, in my own case, money might be of great service to me, but probably it would not be; for the difficulty now is, that I do not improve my opportunities, and therefore I am not prepared to have my opportunities increased. Now, I warn you, if it be as you say, you have got to put on the pack of an upland farmer in good earnest the coming spring, the lowland farm being cared for; ay, you must be selecting your seeds forthwith, and doing what winter work you can; and, while others are raising potatoes and Baldwin apples for you, you must be raising apples of the Hesperides for them. (Only hear how he preaches!) No man can suspect that he is the proprietor of an upland farm,—upland in the sense that it will produce nobler crops, and better repay cultivation in the long run,—but he will be perfectly sure that he ought to cultivate it. --Letter to Harrison Blake, February 27th, 1853

<blockquote>
There are nowadays professors of philosophy, but not philosophers. Yet it is admirable to profess because it was once admirable to live. To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically. -- Walden
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I do not speak to those who are well employed, in whatever circumstances, and they know whether they are well employed or not; — but mainly to the mass of men who are discontented, and idly complaining of the hardness of their lot or of the times, when they might improve them. There are some who complain most energetically and inconsolably of any, because they are, as they say, doing their duty. I also have in my mind that seemingly wealthy, but most terribly impoverished class of all, who have accumulated dross, but know not how to use it, or get rid of it, and thus have forged their own golden or silver fetters. -- Walden

<p>Although Thoreau is often felt to be a kind of mountain man or noble savage, in fact he favored a blending of civilization and wildness - and he has, I think, much to teach us about the balance between work and leisure, indoor pursuits and outdoor pursuits, technology and nature, society and solitude, reflection and action, theory and practice, cooperation and independence, complexity and simplicity, the human and the natural. You or I might not place the balance point where he did on all those dimensions, but walking with Thoreau will certainly get each of us thinking about where it belongs.</p>

<li>the upland farm is indeed a farm requiring intentional guidance - pure nature is not enough</li>

<li>water is like attention or focus; by lavishing attention on what is important, I ensure that I focus on what truly matters (the grass is always greener where you water it)</li>
<li>light is like knowledge, like my understanding of what is possible to me; it is true that the sun shines equally upon the lowland farm and the upland farm, yet the upland light is more regular and more pure, since it is unobstructed by the mists and fogs common to the lowlands</li>
<li>air is like freedom (upland air makes free); by pruning back my desires I free myself up for higher pursuits</li>
<li>space is like solitude (cf. Tao); by weeding out distractions I am more attuned to opportunities for learning and more open to experiences of significance</li>
<li>soil is like inner strength; I nourish the roots of my being with a natural fertilizer formed of the slough and dross of my experience and learning (cf. Thoreau on leaves)</li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>In summer we live out of doors, and have only impulses and feelings, which are all for action, and must wait commonly for the stillness and longer nights of autumn and winter before any thought will subside; we are sensible that behind the rustling leaves, and the stacks of grain, and the bare clusters of the grape, there is the field of a wholly new life, which no man has lived; that even this earth was made for more mysterious and nobler inhabitants than men and women. In the hues of October sunsets, we see the portals to other mansions than those which we occupy, not far off geographically....</p>
<p>The moon no longer reflects the day, but rises to her absolute rule, and the husbandman and hunter acknowledge her for their mistress. Asters and golden-rods reign along the way, and the life-everlasting withers not. The fields are reaped and shorn of their pride, but an inward verdure still crowns them. The thistle scatters its down on the pool, and yellow leaves clothe the vine, and naught disturbs the serious life of men. But behind the sheaves, and under the sod, there lurks a ripe fruit, which the reapers have not gathered, the true harvest of the year, which it bears forever, annually watering and maturing it, and man never severs the stalk which bears this palatable fruit.</p>

<blockquote>
A cold and searching wind drives away all contagion, and nothing can withstand it but what has a virtue in it, and accordingly, whatever we meet with in cold and bleak places, as the tops of mountains, we respect for a sort of sturdy innocence, a Puritan toughness. All things beside seem to be called in for shelter, and what stays out must be part of the original frame of the universe, and of such valor as God himself. It is invigorating to breathe the cleansed air. Its greater fineness and purity are visible to the eye, and we would fain stay out long and late, that the gales may sigh through us, too, as through the leafless trees, and fit us for the winter,—as if we hoped so to borrow some pure and steadfast virtue, which will stead us in all seasons. -- A Winter Walk

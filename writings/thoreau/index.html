<h1>The Upland Farm</h1>
<h2>Thoreau on Cultivating a Better Life</h2>
<h2>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h2>
<p>Henry David Thoreau, both naturalist and transcendentalist, always perceived the possibility of living a better life &mdash; some employment on your higher ground, which he called your upland farm. His writings encourage you to live deliberately, to pursue a path you can walk with love and reverence, to advance confidently in the direction of your dreams.</p>
<p>Although Thoreau is often thought of as a mountain man or noble savage, in fact he favored a blending of civilization and wildness &mdash; and he still has much to teach us about the balance between work and leisure, society and solitude, nature and humanity, reflection and action, theory and practice.</p>
<p>In <cite>Walden</cite>, Thoreau said that to be a philosopher is so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates. <cite>The Upland Farm</cite> explores Thoreau's timeless views on ethics and happiness for modern readers in an inspiring yet practical way.</p>
<p>The book will always be available for free <a href='upland-farm.html'>on this website</a>, along with a companion volume of selections from Thoreau's writings entitled <a href='seasons.html'>Seasons of Thoreau</a>. Kindle and paperback versions will be published in time for the bicentennial of Thoreau's birth on July 12, 2017.</p>

<h1>Tales of Slow Time</h1>
<h2>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h2>
<p>I've been thinking about writing a set of linked short stories entitled <cite>Tales of Slow Time</cite>, set in the late 21st or early 22nd century. It will be a time of extremely rapid change and constant flux. Because humans won't be able to absorb change at that rate, they will be even further dumbed down and domesticated compared to today, living as they will in a culture of convenience, pleasure, entertainment, and post-literacy. The influence of raw intelligence will be even more keenly felt (cf. the seven tribes), resulting in extreme inequality. Governments everywhere will have implemented a universal basic income to placate the great mass of people who would otherwise have no livelihood. However, most people will therefore have too much free time: some will use that time to cause trouble, meddle, protest; others will play immersive video games or plug into virtual worlds; others will engage in simulacra of productivity (incubators of nothing). The human population will be declining. Information technology will be pervasive: robots will perform many routine and non-routine tasks; algorithms will rule the day; people will be subject to ubiquitous tracking, profiling, surveillance, and manipulation through advertising, marketing, nudging, and helpthink; we will experience the gamification of all activities and human/machine interactions; news, information, audio, video, AR/VR, holography - anything presented or represented through networks or computers - will be essentially made up (fiat everything); people will have little certainty about what is real. Everything and everyone will be mapped, tracked, annotated, recorded via the hypermap and the ledger. Robots will be our friends and teachers; machines will perceive our moods; all of our choices will be "suggested" by algorithms. Corporations and governments will engage in lifelong observation and manipulation of each and every individual. There will be no privacy, no autonomy, no serenity, no humanity. We will live in a materially abundant spiritual wasteland ruled by impersonal forces of government, science, technology, corporations, insurers, medicine, politics, even the arts.</p>
<p>But there will be a significant minority of refuseniks, called slowtimers, who will prefer to interact in human ways, unmediated by computers and robots and algorithms. Slowtimers will do things in old-fashioned ways: they will prefer bicycling and walking; engage in farming, gardening, and cooking; cultivate the arts of reading and conversation; pursue careers and hobbies as artists and craftspeople and storytellers and such; labor in cooperatives and other human-scale organizations; produce and experience live music, plays, dance, readings, and other in-person experiences that canâ€™t be faked; experience a veneration for what is old (rivers, trees, mountains, temples, festivals, pubs, books, music, wisdom); build structures, establish institutions, and plant things that are built to last. Slowtimers will persist in all parts of the world and will be variously tolerated, segregated into certain localities, even forced onto reservations. They will exist in shadowy areas on the hypermap where people mostly live off the ledger with no Internet and no computers, communicating in person and by pre-net methods like radio and letter. Slowtimer communities will prize localism and will be largely self-sufficient. Religions and philosophies of various kinds will play a prominent role through retreats, churches, prayer, and liturgical time. However, there will be no one creed because there are many sources of personalism (Taoism, Zen, Catholicism, Confucianism, Epicureanism, and others). Slowtimers will seek out deeply active and personal antidotes to impersonalism: callings and creative pursuits, close relationships, learning and inquiry, involvement in community, etc.</p>

<h3>Chapter 35: The Noble Soul</h3>

<hr/>
<p>I am capable of great things. But it takes enormous discipline to truly understand the world and myself, to focus my energy and attention on what I find interesting and important, to create value in myself, in my relationships, and in my projects. It would be much easier to float through life and to depend on the achievements of others.</p>
<p>Yet to do so would be unworthy of a truly human being. If I abdicate my responsibilities and do not live up to my potential, then I forsake the birthright of a glorious, successful human life. Deeply positive thought, choice, action, and feeling are right and proper to a noble soul &mdash; and if I do not strive for nobility, why am I here?</p>

<h3>Chapter 32: The Sovereign Individual</h3>

<hr/>
<p>Roark said that thought, choice, action, and feeling are the functions of the self. In order to live a successful human life, I must be independent in my thinking, my choices, my actions, and my feelings. It is this independence that Roark possesses but that Keating lacks.</p>
<p>Independence gives me ultimate power over my own life. Not power over others, but power over myself: the inner strength to understand reality, to direct my energy and attention, to create value, to experience meaning.</p>
<p>To be independent in this way is to be a sovereign individual, to be a law-maker for myself, to be a self-governor.</p>
<p>This supreme independence makes me free.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Understanding others is knowledge, but understanding myself is enlightenment; mastering others is power, but mastering myself is strength. Therefore in knowledge there is power, but in enlightenment there is strength.</p>
<p>Being selective about others is preference, but being selective about myself is simplicity; experiencing others is pleasure, but experiencing myself is depth. Therefore in preference there is pleasure, but in simplicity there is depth.</p>
<p>Knowledge, power, preference, and pleasure are signs of desire; enlightenment, strength, simplicity, and depth are signs of purpose.</p>
<p>When I focus primarily on controlling others or seeking their approval, I live second-hand and thus I am on the path to desire, dissolution, and dependence. When I focus primarily on improving myself, I live first-hand and thus I am on the path to purpose, integrity, and autonomy.</p>

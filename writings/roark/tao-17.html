<h3>Chapter 17: Self-Trust</h3>

<hr/>
<p>Just as I am the easiest person to deceive, so I am the hardest person to trust.</p>
<p>To be trustworthy inside and out, I must have great command of myself, great mastery of my emotions, great loyalty to my principles, great constancy of purpose, great internal discipline. I must keep straight, guide myself, monitor myself, point myself in a consistent direction, set my own path in life, live up to my ideals, and aspire to the highest excellence I can achieve.</p>
<p>To be trustworthy inside and out, I must have a strong moral compass within me, and not merely respond to pressures and sanctions that come from outside of me. I must choose my own principles and command my own laws, for myself alone and for no one else. I must be sovereign, autonomous, and a more strict governor of my own actions than any external force could ever be.</p>
<p>To be trustworthy inside and out, I must do what I want. As Peter Keating observed, this is not the easiest thing in the world but the hardest: to know what I truly want, what is best for me, what is consistent with my highest potential &mdash; and then to have the courage of my convictions by working tirelessly to achieve that in my life.</p>
<p>To mine own self be true &mdash; this requires deep self-knowledge and great self-discipline. Self-respect, self-esteem, self-consideration, and self-love are secondary effects &mdash; feelings that can only be based on the hard-won reality of self-worth. I must not confuse the cause and the effect.</p>

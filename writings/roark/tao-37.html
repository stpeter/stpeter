<h3>Chapter 37: Freedom</h3>

<hr/>
<p><cite>The Fountainhead</cite> is a novel of freedom.</p>
<p>This freedom is not political but personal: the freedom of self-reliance, of skill, of being capable of surviving and thriving in the world, of standing on my own two feet, of moving through life with strength and competence and independence.</p>
<p>This freedom is the positive liberty to do what matters &mdash; to create, to produce, to think, to choose, to act, to feel, to live.</p>
<p>This freedom is the liberation of holding nothing back from my life, of being fundamentally open to experience, of actively seeking after enlightenment, dignity, depth, and beauty.</p>
<p>This freedom is the true wealth of creativity, of friendship, of love, of knowing what I truly want, of doing what I truly value, of being what I aspire to be.</p>
<p>This freedom is the result of self-governance, self-mastery, and self-trust &mdash; for when I trust myself completely, I do not need to depend on some authority outside of myself and my own relationship to reality.</p>
<p>This freedom brings the ultimate security and leads to the ultimate serenity.</p>
<p>Yet this freedom can be approached only from the side. I cannot grasp it directly. It must grow within me and around me, through the decisions and actions I take every day, through the responsibilities I shoulder, through the powers I exercise. The liberation I experience is a sign of success, and results from the hard work of personal responsibility.</p>

<p>Honoring the power of thought brings me great enlightenment, but sometimes greater enlightenment comes from not thinking.</p>
<p>Sometimes I have thought everything I can think for now, as Howard Roark did when went for a swim at the quarry instead of planning the next phase of his life.</p>
<p>It is pointless to think and plan far beyond the horizon of my lifespan. History provides valuable perspective, but I cannot change the past. Envisioning the future helps me navigate my direction in life, but the future might change so radically that I am better off learning to be flexible than becoming attached to the way I think things will be.</p>
<p>It is more productive to think about what is within my control than to worry and fret about things that are outside of my control. Worrying is not a form of thinking.</p>
<p>Much of what happens is not worthy of my attention. Fads, fashions, celebrities, news, propaganda, advertising, politicians, and the like are meaningless ephemera. If I know how many things are unimportant in the world, I can focus on what is truly important in my own life.</p>

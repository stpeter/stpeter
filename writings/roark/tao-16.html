<h3>Chapter 16: Respect</h3>
<hr/>
<p>Previous: <a href='tao-15.html'>Chapter 15: Responsibility</a></p>
<hr/>
<p>Respect is the essence of responsibility in a social context.</p>
<p>Respect is my recognition that you too are a choosing being, that you too must make your own decisions and select your own values and achieve your own happiness, that you too have the same desire that I do to succeed in living a fully human life.</p>
<p>If I am a good and worthy person, the prospect of earning my respect challenges you to become more responsible and to live up to your highest standards. If you are a good and worthy person, you inspire greater responsibility and moral ambition in me. Earning respect is not living second-hand, as long as I choose to interact with those I can honestly respect and admire. Calling each other to responsibility is one of the great values of friendship; yet here too my actions can also influence the broader culture of interactions I have with all people, not only those who are dear to me.</p>
<p>There is a beautiful Sanskrit word that captures the essence of such respect: <em>namaste</em>. It means: "the divine in me honors the divine in you".</p>

<h1>The Tao of Roark</h1>
<h2>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h2>
<h3>Chapter 23: The Inner Life</h3>
<hr/>
<p>Previous: <a href='tao-22.html'>Chapter 22: Compassion</a></p>
<hr/>
<p>The hardest passion to accept is my passion for myself; the most difficult person to love is myself; the attention I most resist is directed within.</p>
<p>To experience life inside myself, I must accept my feelings as signs and signals of what I truly value, I must take clear perception as a precondition of strong feeling, I must listen to myself and train myself to hear, I must attend to the fine gradations of my emotional experience.</p>
<p>The inner life involves true joy in the senses, for seeing and hearing and touching and tasting are deeply human ways to know and love what is.</p>
<p>When I cultivate my inner life, I attend to myself; I am not afraid to be alone, indeed I revel in solitude and I enjoy my own companionship.</p>
<p>Can I be a friend to myself? Can I honor myself? Can I be self-contained yet still reach out to others and to the world at large? Can I grant myself compassion and empathy and understanding while never giving up my drive for self-improvement? Can I love myself in the toughest and tenderest ways possible, and strive above all to be worthy of such reverence? Can I hold onto my dreams, hopes, ideals, aspirations, deepest interests, and inner passions? Can I refuse to float on the surface of life but instead dive deep within myself in a search for individual freedom, personal dignity, spiritual depth, and moral beauty? Can I do all this without pretension, with simplicity and seriousness and humility and a realization of how far I have yet to go in my search for joy and reason and meaning?</p>

<h3>Chapter 19: Collaboration</h3>

<hr/>
<p>Collaboration is the essence of productivity in a social context.</p>
<p>Collaboration is my recognition that you too are an active being, that often you and I can achieve more together than apart, that often the creation of value is not a solitary pursuit but a matter of mutual achievement, focus, discipline, energy, and aspiration &mdash; a matter of being drawn together toward a shared goal in a shared pursuit based on shared values.</p>
<p>There are many challenges here. If there is no self-direction without self-discipline, is there also no shared direction without shared discipline? How can I respect your individuality within a group effort? It helps that you have your own domains of expertise and I have mine, that you and I can divide up the work so that you have your tasks and I have mine &mdash; but you and I always face the dangers of groupthink, of hierarchy, of power, of holding the organization above the individual. I must continually be mindful of these dangers if you and I are to work together with mutual respect and complete voluntarism.</p>

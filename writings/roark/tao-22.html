<h3>Chapter 22: Compassion</h3>
<hr/>
<p>Previous: <a href='tao-21.html'>Chapter 21: Passion</a></p>
<hr/>
<p>Compassion is the essence of passion in a social context.</p>
<p>Compassion is my recognition that you too are a feeling being, that you too experience the emotional meaning of life in irreducibly individual ways, that you too are capable of pleasure and pain, joy and suffering, triumph and tragedy &mdash; that you too have opened yourself to great feeling and to the vulnerability such openness brings.</p>
<p>Can I give you empathy without pity, understanding without condescension, attentiveness without influence, commitment without exclusion? Can I help to bring out the best in you without seeking to direct your life? Can I see what is best for your life without seeking to impose it upon you? Can I treat all people with humanity, some with fellowship, fewer with friendship, fewer still with great love &mdash; without falling prey to the traps of in-groups and out-groups, judging without individual understanding, and the false alternative of deification versus demonization? Can I use my broad understanding of life not as a means to ignore your context but as the basis for treating you with presence and perspective? Can I feel great joy in your success while remaining independent in my own happiness? Can I see my relationships as a source of great value without basing my self-worth on the approval of others? Can I give my love precisely because those I love are not my chief reason for living?</p>
<p>These are the challenges of compassion.</p>

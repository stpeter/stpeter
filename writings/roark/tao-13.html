<h3>Chapter 13: Honesty</h3>

<p>Previous: <a href='tao-12.html'>Chapter 12: Objectivity</a></p>
<hr/>
<p>Honesty is the essence of objectivity in a social context.</p>
<p>Honesty is my recognition that you too are a thinking being, that you too have the same cognitive relationship to the world that I do, that you too have the same desire to know that I do, that both of us are focused on the same reality and thus will likely come to similar conclusions if you and I both use our powers of thought.</p>
<p>My honesty enables you to be more objective. Your honesty enables me to be more objective. Indeed, my honesty also enables me to be more objective, because it instills in me a habit of truthfulness. By being honest with each other, you and I build a shared commitment to recognizing reality and sustain a shared culture of achieving objectivity.</p>

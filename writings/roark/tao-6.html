<p>In her marriage to Peter Keating, Dominique Francon was perfectly selfless: she displayed no initiative, no desire, no independence, no will, no self, no soul. But what is the self or the soul? It is the thing inside me that thinks, values, makes decisions, and feels.</p>
<p>Roark knew this, too. As he said in his courtroom defense, the functions of the self are to think, to judge, to act, and to feel.</p>
<p>Thought, choice, action, and feeling. In these four human powers, properly understood, can be found a complete philosophy of living.</p>
<p>This insight provides the basis of the Tao of Roark &mdash; the foundation for my harmonic explorations &mdash; the bass line upon which I build my variations.</p>

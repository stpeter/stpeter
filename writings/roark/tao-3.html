<h3>Chapter 3: Joy</h3>

<p>Howard Roark laughed.</p>
<p>When faced with expulsion from engineering school and the end of his dream of becoming an architect, he didn't whine or complain. He didn't get angry. He didn't blame his misfortune on the government or the schools or the culture at large. He didn't plead with the dean for reinstatement. He didn't worry or fret. He didn't collapse in fear and despair over his career prospects. He didn't even start thinking and planning about what to do next.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Instead, he went for a long walk to his favorite swimming hole, took off his clothes, and dove down into the cool deep waters to enjoy himself and relax.</p>
<p>And, because he wanted to, he laughed.</p>

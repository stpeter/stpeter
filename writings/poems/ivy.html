<h1>Ivy, My Enemy</h1>
<h2>by Peter Saint-Andre</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
There's something quite creepy about ivy<br />
that makes it act all too alivey:<br />
the slithering mass of it climbs up your house<br />
and clings to your stone or your brick;<br />
its feet are like glue and its stalk grows as thick<br />
as a snake in your garden that's swallowed a mouse.
</p>
<p>
On the ground, I suppose, the plant's not such a pest &#151;<br />
but when it climbs, my loathing cannot be expressed.<br />
No, I'm never afraid to assert my opinion<br />
about this green menace of the vast plant dominion:<br />
though some people say that the vine has its worth,<br />
I'd just as soon see it removed from the earth!

<p style='text-align:center'>
if you strip away the labels and isms and meta tags, what are you left with?<br />
or, more to the point, what I am left with? am I strong and free<br />
enough as an individual to survive the loss of all those<br />
crutches and carve out a life of joy and reason<br />
and meaning? can I use my powers of<br />
thought and choice and action<br />
and feeling to seek and<br />
find my own way?<br />
the Greeks said<br />
know thyself.<br />
I know<br />
me.<br />
I know<br />
it is only<br />
my own efforts<br />
that will produce a<br />
life of eudaimonia for<br />
myself and bring joy to those<br />
who are dear to me, that will enable me<br />
to create the kinds of thoughts and words and<br />
music that fire the mind and inspire the soul; to find ever<br />
greater wisdom through reflection on work, love, art, ideas, family,<br />
and friendship; and to realize my vision of a philosophy for living on earth.

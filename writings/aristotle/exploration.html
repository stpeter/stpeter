<h1>Complete Yourself</h1>
<h2>Suggestions for Further Exploration</h2>

<p>Although Aristotle's own writings are not easy to read, they reward deep study. Among translators of Aristotle, I much prefer Joe Sachs, who has rendered the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> and other key works into English. Unfortunately there is no <em>great</em> translation of the <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite>, so I have started to make one.</p>

<p>Several somewhat popular expositions are worth reading: <cite>Aristotle: A Very Short Introduction</cite> by Jonathan Barnes, <Cite>Aristotle's Way</cite> by Edith Hall, <cite>Aristotle</cite> by John Herman Randall, <cite>In Pursuit of the Good</cite> by Eric Salem, and <cite>Aristotle's Ethics</cite> by J.O. Urmson.</p>

<p>The scholarly literature on Aristotle is vast. Here I have found the following works especially valuable: <cite>Ethics with Aristotle</cite> by Sarah Broadie, <cite>Aristotle's Man</cite> by Stephen Clark, <cite>Action and Character According to Aristotle</cite> by Kevin Flannery, <cite>Confronting Aristotle's Ethics</cite> by Eugene Garver, <cite>The Aristotelian Ethics</cite> and <cite>Aristotle on the Perfect Life</cite> by Anthony Kenny, <cite>Aristotelian Interpretations</cite> by Fran O'Rourke, and <cite>Taking Life Seriously</cite> by Frances Sparshott.</p>

<p><cite>Complete Yourself</cite> is the third volume in a six-movement suite of books I'm writing on the art of living:</p>

<h2>Positive Psychology: An Aristotelian Analysis</h2>
<h3>by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>Last Updated: 2021-03-24</p>
<p>Positive Psychology is one of the most intriguing and encouraging intellectual developments of the last twenty years. Instead of focusing on what goes wrong in human life (mental illness, personality disorders, and the like), Positive Psychology focuses on what goes right &mdash; in particular, on strengths of character. Although the Positive Psychology movement takes inspiration from Aristotle, as far as I can determine its primary advocates have not truly engaged with Aristotelian philosophy. This is unfortunate, because Aristotle's abiding insights into character and human action can sharpen and deepen the psychological understanding provided by Positive Psychology. In this paper I sketch the beginnings of a more cross-disciplinary approach.</p>
<p>First, a summary of Aristotle's views is in order. Building on yet in some ways diverging from the earlier work of Socrates and Plato, Aristotle (384-322 BCE) analyzed a number of ancient Greek concepts related to human life, including εὐδαιμονία (eudaimonia = flourishing or happiness), ἀρετή (arete = excellence or virtue), ἕξις (hexis = trait or disposition), πρᾶξις (praxis = action or conduct), πάθος (pathos = reaction or feeling), προαίρεσις (prohairesis = commitment or choice), τέλος (telos = purpose or goal), φιλία (love or friendship), and φρόνησις (phronesis = wisdom or know-how). For our purposes I will focus on arete, since it is so close to the central Positive Psychology concept of a strength.</p>
<p>According to Aristotle, an excellence of character is a stable trait of choice, activity, and feeling acquired through repeated practice and personal reflection. Each such excellence (courage, justice, moderation, wisdom, and so on) is a matter of "hitting the target" with regard to a particular domain of action or reaction in life, and doing so in a reasonable way that avoids the related extremes (e.g., in the case of courage, timidity and rashness). Yet the highest excellence is not merely intermediate between extremes (what's now called Aristotle's "doctrine of the mean"), but consists of acting and reacting beautifully to the situation you find yourself in. Even though such activity can have beneficial consequences, the σπουδαῖος &mdash; person who takes life seriously &mdash; engages in such activity for its own sake. Furthermore, the fully virtuous person finds great joy in doing the right thing: excellence of character does not require self-restraint or self-control, but involves cultivating the healthiest actions and reactions as a kind of second nature.</p>

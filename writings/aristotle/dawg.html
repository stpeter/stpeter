<h1>Distributed Aristotle Working Group (DAWG)</h1>
<h2>Dedicated to the Passionate Search for Passionless Truth</h2>

<p>The individuals who collaborate as the Distributed Aristotle Working Group (DAWG) do so for the sake of mutual benefit, greater insight, and increased production of significant philosophical work within the Aristotelian tradition. Our core values are as follows.</p>

<h3>Serious Scholarship</h3>
<p>By directing our attention to the foundational works of Aristotle, we stay grounded in high standards of philosophical discourse. All participants also have some facility in ancient Greek so that we can come to understand Aristotle in his original language.</p>

<h3>Focus on Essentials</h3>
<p>We are dedicated to philosophical work at the deepest level. We concentrate on the timeless topics of knowledge, being, and the good, and eschew discussion of ephemera such as contemporary politics and culture. However, we always keep in mind the practical applications of philosophical truths, since the primary purpose of philosophical insight is eudaimonia.</p>

<h3>Voluntary Interaction</h3>
<p>We are a loosely-coupled network of individuals who come together voluntarily. We are not a legal organization of any kind, we take no collective positions, we require no dues, we have no members or staff, and we do not engage in lobbying or prosleytizing. New participants are accepted only by invitation and unanimous agreement among the current participants.</p>

<h3>Respect and Benevolence</h3>
<p>We do not argue or debate in an agonistic way. Instead, we collaborate in a spirit of mutual benefit, helping each other to gain deeper knowledge and to produce better works than we could do otherwise. We also recognize that, through intellectual friendship, we can more fully realize lives that are animated by philosophy in its original sense: the love and practice of wisdom.</p>

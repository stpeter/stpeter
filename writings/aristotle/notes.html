<h1>Notes Toward Complete Yourself</h1>
<p>Last Updated: 2019-03-10</p>
<p>Here are some of the topics and passages I'm pondering in preparation for writing <a href='/writings/aristotle/'>Complete Yourself: Aristotle on Personal Excellence</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Topics 8.5 on dialectic (cf. Nussbaum)</li>
<li>EE 1222a5 on serenity / ataraxia</li>
<li>Balance between excess and defect as “the more and the less” along a continuum of behavior (cf. Cooper p. 101); achieved through application of reason and discrimination, and through integration of thinking and striving (cf. Gottlieb p. 110)</li>
<li>Phronesis applies to a wide range of even “non-moral” goods (1098b12-14, Cooper p.106)</li>
<li>Axia (worth) at 1123b17</li>
<li>Actualizing potential: Metaphysics 1048a with respect to orexis and prohairesis</li>
<li>A thriving of character is not an emotion, but a practice or settled disposition that can cause you to experience a certain emotion in a certain way, on certain occasions, etc. (Gottlieb 48); reason is involved, so a thriving is discriminating and involves choice (EE 1234a24), whereas a failing is indiscriminate because it is always excessive (Gottlieb 78); thus balance is a particular instance of philosophy as the love and practice of wisdom</li>
<li>Integration: EN 1166a13, 1178a16 (cf. Gottlieb pp. 104-106)</li>
<li>Choosing arete both for its own sake and for the sake of eudaimonia (cf. Gottlieb pp. 140ff): this is made clearer by the distinction between energeia (working at a task) and entelecheia (achieving a goal) because I might enjoy the work itself while recognizing that the work is necessary to achieve the goal - the example of performing music at a concert</li>
<li>Theoria is not passive but active (Politics 7.3)</li>
<li>Prohairesis is the intended result of deliberation (1112a15-16) = planning; see also 1140a24-28 on planning and 1144a28-29 on putting plans into effect as aspects of phronesis</li>
<li>For Aristotle, the exercise of a craft is always for the sake of the product (EN 6.4 etc.) not the activity, and thus of lower importance - yet this is factually incorrect (Urmson p. 102) ... can techne be an instance of theoria?</li>
<li>Sophrosune concerns the pleasures that result from indulging in sensation, not the pleasures inherent in an activity itself, such as the pleasure of learning (Urmson pp. 107-108)</li>
<li>To kalon: 1115b5, 1104b30, 1115b18, 1366a33, 145a22 ... does beauty apply primarily to character and being, not single acts?</li>
<li>What range of activites and practices are required for the human way of life (bios)? (cf. Lennox on the more and the less) ... at root *this* is the skopos, and things outside this range are missing the mark</li>
<li>There is a continuum of worth from beastly to bad/ugly to unrestrained to self-controlled to good/beautiful to divine/makar ... to thrive is to excel along this continuum, not to be “moderate” (but: to excel is to achieve a reasoned, discriminating balance between excess and defect, again see Lennox, Gottlieb, etc.)</li>
<li>An animal cannot be eudaimon because it does not have a daimon, yet it can flourish when it works at the task of its aliveness, its way of living. For us, eudaimonia is working at the task of human aliveness and the human way of living over a complete life in accordance with the thrivings of thought, action, and emotion. The most beautiful way of life for a human being (in the NE!) is working at the task of active inquiry into the nature and meaning of things in accordance with the most goal-worthy human thriving, which is wisdom or sagacity.</li>
<li>A daimon was a guiding spirit assigned by the fates before your birth: in modern terms your inborn personality. Against this, see Heraclitus: “daimon is ethos”, i.e., acquired character (not inborn personality) is your guiding spirit.</li>
<li>For Aristotle, the forking of sophia and phronesis is necessitated by the differences between the sublunary and superlunary realms. But we moderns recognize no such differences, and even he said “there are gods here too”. (Aristotle thought that even bees share in the divine.) How valid is the distinction between sophia and phronesis? Is it even consistent with his guidelines for definition? And does it appear only in the NE, not in the EE?</li>
<li>To thrive at X is to have a consistent, deliberate practice of mindfully and appropriately doing X instead of mindlessly or inappropriately under-doing or over-doing X. (Example from Aristotle’s practice: mindfully working at the appropriate level of precision in a given field of inquiry.) Not hitting the mark is a falling away from mindful practice, perhaps succumbing to one’s innate propensities or to natural temptations.</li>
<li>Thriving of character is directed toward action; it shapes emotional reactions when those emotions are necessarily action-oriented (e.g, fear and anger); less “practical” emotions (e.g., shame and indignation) are experienced by those of good character, but do not have an associated thriving (cf Fortenbaugh).</li>
<li>There are analogies between the organization of the city and the organization of the soul - for instance, the importance of noble leadership, good education, and giving each class or role its due (cf. Politics, MA 703a29). See also Aristotle on bees.</li>
<li>Other goals (modern ideals): creativity as a form of inquiry, philanthropy as a form of social leadership.</li>
<li>A living thing does not have a goal from outside itself, it is a goal within itself (Sachs, intro to De Anima). This goal is the completion of its nature.</li>
<li>For any entity, its eidos or form is its way of being (Sachs, intro to Physics); for a living thing, its eidos is its bios or way of living, pursued for the sake of its psuche, i.e. its continued aliveness as the kind of thing it is. Thus its life is working at the task of living, and it is fully alive when it achieves its goal of completing its nature.</li>
<li>Thus: character is the completion of nature; arete is a perfection and kakia is a “loss” (Physics 7.3).</li>
<li>Is wisdom too a perfection of nature? And what are the contraries of wisdom, the fallings-away from nature with respect to mental thriving? And is wisdom a mean? If so, what is the overdoing or overthinking involved? Note: In the EE, phronesis is a mean between cunning and stupidity.</li>
<li>If wisdom is the sum of the intellectual excellences (is it??), then is there a parallel thriving with regard to yearning aliveness? Can it be megalopsuchia if psuche includes both thinking and yearning aliveness? (No: megalopsuchia concerns itself only with great honors.)</li>
<li>Educational role of a sophronistes (Constitution of Athens, 42), who encourages and enforces sophrosune.</li>
<li>Philosophy as a cooperative enterprise (Lynch, Aristotle’s School)</li>
<li>Divinity as leisure, inquiry, serenity, order. (We ascribe these qualities to the gods, but in fact they are human ideals.)</li>
<li>Hexis - Is this a distinctively human phenomenon? How are mental powers involved? See Categories on living and talking as ways to shape hexeis. But different species of animal have different natural characters, and this is true of individual animals as well (say, Boucephalus); yet the motive force of a change in an animal’s characteristic actions comes from outside, not from within.</li>
<li>Ethos is the source of motion (the efficient cause) of all/most human activity - not an epiphenomenon or a mere ornament, but the prime mover of personal excellence and your success in life. (See below.)</li>
<li>All animals are self-movers, but only human beings are self-movers of the source of motion, since we alone can choose to change our way of thinking and acting.</li>
<li>What is best is a telos, i.e., what completes a being’s nature. (EE 1.8) Note that this includes your individual nature. (See below on teleiotaton as “most completing”.) The telos is that for the sake of which one acts.</li>
<li>The goal here is similar to what it is to be healthy or to be in good shape. We can think of it as being in great shape both intellectually and ethically. (What kind of training is needed to make that happen?)</li>
<li>But what’s best is not the mere state or condition, but the energeia - the active work (ergon) and use (chresis) you can achieve when you are in great shape. The highest goal is what you *accomplish* with your vitality. Not virtue ethics, but achievement ethics. (See below on biocentric ethics.)</li>
<li>Orexis is an impulse to reach out and move toward something, whereas thinking it through (dianoia) is a countervailing force to hold back the movement and control the impulse.</li>
<li>Achievement requires not just activity but forethought and planning.</li>
<li>Distinction between behavior and action? We don’t say that animals take action. In this sense action is planned, chosen, deliberate.</li>
<li>Phusis as eidos (193b3-4)</li>
<li>The three forms of orexis: craving or need for what’s pleasant, feeling (?) or want for what’s advantageous, resolving or wish for what’s right. To the wise person, there is harmony between these: right reasoning leads to right reaching. (cf Pearson)</li>
<li>Are the three forms of life (NE I.5) connected to these three forms of orexis and of the good? The life of pleasure (epithumia for what’s enjoyable), of community (thumos for relative position or advantage), and of inquiry (boulesis for what is right and beautiful). This feels somewhat forced because an arete like courage can be for the sake of to kalon...</li>
<li>Is thumos related to gain and loss (advantage and threat)? Perhaps this is the object that induces excitement. Possible evidence: the three forms of philia (pleasure, gain, and rightness - enjoyable, useful, and beautiful relationships).</li>
<li>What is the relationship between thumos and pathos? Lists of the pathe (cf Pearson 115; 221) occur at 403a17, 1105b21, 1106b18, 1220b12, 1378a20. Can they all be defined as occurring in the thumoeides? Many of these are related to gain or loss.</li>
<li>Pursuit and avoidance: Topics 104b1.</li>
<li>Orthos logos = correct reasoning; orthos orexis = correct reaching.</li>
<li>Knowing the goal and judging aright: 995a34ff. It is necessary to go through the aporiai beforehand. The clueless wanderer does not know the goal because he does not grasp what is truly good. Even before being able to wander about, one might be stuck at the perceptual level (Metaph A.1-2) of what merely appears good (often this is what’s immediately pleasant or what brings immediate advantage). Only by understanding the principles involved can you become sophos (cf Metaph A.2-3). On all this see Buddensiek, “Aporia in Aristotle’s Metaphysics Beta”</li>
<li>The ergon of dianoia is acquiring knowledge and wisdom. The ergon of orexis is acquiring what is enjoyable, advantageous, or right.</li>
<li>These erga are activities guided by practices and pursued for the sake of living. A biocentric ethics, not primarily a virtue ethics. Philosophia as bios, aliveness as eidos.</li>
<li>The human way of life is constituted by practices of thought and action; teleiotaton as “most completing” of human nature. (What about the self sufficiency requirement? Does that have something to do with completing your *own* nature?) (cf Kenny)</li>
<li>The focus on theoria in NE 10 is a legacy of Platonism (cf. Richardson Lear); the blended or balanced life described in the EE is more naturally Aristotelian.</li>
<li>Truly rational action results in eudaimonia because it takes all the grounds of flourishing into account; this is not rationalistic but naturalistic.</li>
<li>Practical reasoning: set a goal; make a plan; choose an action; do it.</li>
<li>What is ethos (character)? It is how you always or usually choose to act and think - your way of being, like a second nature. Ethos as eidos.</li>
<li>There are deep connections among eidos, energeia, psuche, and telos. At some level they are all the same thing.</li>
<li>In Metaphysics Book 9, Aristotle argues that complete actuality (as among the immortals or the prime mover) cannot be used for both good and bad outcomes (as can be produced by the rational powers of techne); yet this is true of arete, too! Is arete thus also a kind of complete actuality? Note also energeia as "in action" vs *being* an actuality (cf. paper by Silvia Fazzo).</li>
<li>Phronesis leads to a balanced, measured response - and we measure according to a standard (kanon).</li>
<li>Arete is a matter of reliably and enjoyably doing what’s beautifully right. This is the true foundation of self-trust.</li>
<li>Unlike making (poiesis), in which the goal is the thing made and thus outside the activity, with taking action (praxis) the activity itself is the goal (1140b4-6). Thus the goal and standard of taking action cannot be subjective well-being or the psychological feeling of enjoyment or happiness, even though such a feeling might reliably accompany good action.</li>
<li>Justice vs seeking to gain more than you deserve (pleonexia = avarice as overreaching, but at EE 3.1 kerdos) or accepting less than you deserve (zemia = diffidence as underreaching); note here the connection to advantage</li>
<li>Friendship or love (philia) is an arete too, but in what sense is it a form of balance and what are its opposites?</li>
<li>With respect to δεῖ (ought to or bound to) &mdash; I am bound to do what is beautifully right only if I have a settled practice of doing so; thus this is a kind of self-binding. I act for the sake of what is beautifully right because I have a settled yearning to be surpassingly good, because I have within myself a consistent striving for the divine.</li>
<li>The term τέλος (goal or completion, not 'perfection') comes from racing: you don't perfect a race, but you do complete it; and completing it consists in reaching the goal or arriving at the destination. Similarly with the terms τελεία (complete or perhaps completing) and τελειώτατον (most complete or perhaps most completing). Translating these terms with some variation of the word 'perfect' is misleading and gives the impression of a Platonic, Neo-Platonic, or godly existence without the slightest blemish.</li>
<li>Integration: if you achieve complete excellence, you experience harmony among your goals, thoughts, choices, feelings, and actions (cf 1008b14-15 etc.).</li>
<li>Complete praxis *is* energeia, and living well is an example thereof: Met. 9.6 (1048b18-35); cf 1174b2-9.</li>

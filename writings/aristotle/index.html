<h1>A Worthy Life</h1>
<h2>The Essence of Aristotelian Ethics</h2>
<h2>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h2>
<p>Although Aristotle's ethical philosophy can be hard to understand, much of that difficulty stems from poor translations of his core ethical concepts and from a myopic focus on his <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> without considering his writings on biology, psychology, rhetoric, logic, and metaphysics. This short epitome will be a friendly guide to his conception of the good life. The working draft is <a href='worthy-life.html'>here</a>.</p>

<h1>Lecture Course: Aristotle on Living Well</h1>
<h2>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h2>
<p>Last Updated: 2019-07-06</p>

<p><em>Note: This is an experimental outline for a lecture course about Aristotle's views on the good life.</em></p>

<h3>LECTURE 1 - eudaimonia</h3>
<ul>
<li>About me</li>
<li>About you</li>
<li>About Aristotle</li>
<li>Why study Aristotle? To live better</li>
<li>Who can benefit? Those who have life experience and are basically good</li>
<li>But there are difficulties: language, style, culture, philosophy</li>
<li>And our source materials are not consistent: NE, EE, MM, Politics</li>
<li>All of these books are focused on one core concept: eudaimonia</li>
<li>Eudaimonia is attended by enjoyment but is not merely a feeling of happiness; it is practical activity grounded in excellence of character and decision-making</li>
<li>Another way to look at it: eudaimonia is an enjoyable combination of eupraxia (successful action) and euboulia (successful reflection)</li>
<li>Thus eudaimonia is an achievement and a completion or perfection of human nature, like hitting the bull's eye in archery</li>
<li>But there are several ways to go astray or miss the target: total corruption of character (pursuing bad and wrong goals in life), impulsiveness (knowing what's right and good but not doing it), even mere self-control (doing what's right and good but reluctantly or painfully)</li>
<li>What are the causes or success or failure? Nature, nurture, and choice</li>
<li>Hitting the target consists not just in succeeding temporarily or in one area of life, but in crafting a life worth living</li>
<li>The "three lives" of pleasure, community involvement, and intellectual inquiry: consider them a thought experiment of how you'd structure your life if you didn't have to work</li>
<li>In modern times there are other lives we consider worth living, such as professional achievement and artistic creativity - how do they fit into an Aristotelian perspective?</li>
</ul>

<h3>LECTURE 2 - relationships</h3>
<ul>
<li>Human beings as social animals</li>
<li>Philia as both love and friendship</li>
<li>The basis of relationships: enjoyment vs. advantage vs. thriving</li>
<li>Marriage: ancient and modern</li>
<li>Child rearing</li>
<li>Community (civic friendship)</li>
<li>Love of self in Aristotle</li>
<li>A friend as another self</li>
<li>Modern individualism</li>
<li>Bridging the gap between individualism and altruism</li>
<li>Relationships as a source of self-knowledge</li>
</ul>

<h3>LECTURE 3 - character</h3>
<ul>
<li>The four virtues in ancient Greek thought: courage, moderation, justice, wisdom (and often piety)</li>
<li>Aristotleâ€™s expanded list: generosity, benevolence, etc.</li>
<li>Motivations for good action: the example of courage</li>
<li>Acting for what is beautifully right</li>
<li>Excellence of character as a balance between extremes</li>
<li>Yet these extremes are a matter of missing the mark - not of sinning</li>
<li>Always a spectrum of behavior: not black and white, not good and evil</li>
<li>Pleasure and pain</li>
<li>The deeply social nature of Greek virtues</li>
<li>But society is different now</li>
<li>Modern excellences: productiveness, frugality, etc.</li>
<li>What is involved in becoming good?</li>
<li>Mindful practice, not mindless habit</li>
<li>Excellence is an integration of character and thought</li>
</ul>

<h3>LECTURE 4 - thought and choice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Human beings as rational animals</li>
<li>Logos as reason-and-speech (this too is social)</li>
<li>Persuasion and counsel</li>
<li>Taking counsel with yourself</li>
<li>Orthos logos as straight thinking</li>
<li>Orthos orexis as straight reaching</li>
<li>Desiderative desire, charged thinking</li>
<li>Pleasure and pain can lead you astray</li>
<li>Balance revisited: counteracting impulses</li>
<li>Choice involves insight into particulars</li>
<li>There are no solid rules for choice and conduct</li>
<li>Practices of thought and persuasion</li>
<li>Planning and forethought</li>
<li>Practical wisdom</li>
<li>Sagacity and the lure of the life of the mind</li>
</ul>

<h3>LECTURE 5 - crafting a life</h3>
<ul>
<li>What makes a suitable goal (telos) for life?</li>
<li>Wealth, fame, power (etc.) as inherently unbounded, unnatural, and unstable</li>
<li>Excellence of character and thought are natural activities</li>
<li>Divine activity as a model for human activity</li>
<li>Unleisured activity exists for the sake of leisured activity</li>
<li>Work, play, and serious leisure</li>
<li>What free people do</li>
<li>Enjoyment of free activity</li>
<li>Philanthropy</li>
<li>The love of wisdom</li>
<li>Kalokagathia - the right and the good</li>
<li>Action for the sake of what is beautifully right</li>
<li>Does your life need one central task or focus?</li>
<li>The role of projects and relationships</li>
<li>Thinking in terms of a life</li>
<li>Philosophical practice: impasse, question, understanding, analysis, synthesis, plan</li>
</ul>

<p><em>What follows is a rough outline for a lecture course about Aristotle's views on the good life. This is a work in progress, currently under heavy revision.</em></p>

<h3>Lecture 1: Eudaimonia</h3>
<ul>
<li>Who was Aristotle? In 384 BC, Aristotle was born at Stagira in northern Greece to his mother Phaestis and father Nicomachus, who was the court physician to Amyntas III, the king of Macedonia; his parents died when he was young and he was then brought up by one Proxenus of Atarneus, who seems to have been a friend of Plato; at age 17 he went to study philosophy in Plato's Academy in Athens and spent the next 20 years as an active member of this research community. After Plato's death in 347 he returned to Atarneus, where he met and married Pythia, the daughter or niece of Hermias, the ruler of Atarneus. From 343 to 336, Aristotle lived in Macedon, where he tutored the young Alexander the Great (grandson of Amyntas). After the death of his wife Pythia Aristotle had a sort of common law marriage with a woman named Herpyllis from his hometown of Stagira. He had a daughter with his wife Pythia (also named Pythia) and a son Nicomachus with Herpyllis. In 336 or 335 Aristotle returned to Athens, where he founded a research community called the Lyceum. In 323, after the death of Alexander the Great, he was charged by the Athenian authorities with impiety (as Socrates had been) and fled to Chalcis, where his mother had an estate; he died soon after at age 62 in 322 BC. Thus, unlike Plato, Epicurus, and other ancient philosophers Aristotle had a spouse and children; however, he never served in the military and seemingly never had to work for a living (although perhaps he was well compensated for his service to rulers and kings). In the midst of his eventful life, Aristotle wrote hundreds of popular and scholarly works on philosophy; originated the sciences of logic and biology; and contributed fundamentally to psychology, natural philosophy, rhetoric, literary analysis, political theory, and ethics.</li>
<li>Isn't Aristotle's philosophy hopelessly out of date? Although it's true that ancient Greek society was very different from ours and scientific knowledge has progress enormously since then, the fundamentals of human nature have remained constant and it is here that Aristotle's insights are most useful</li>
<li>Why study Aristotle's writings on ethics? Not just to learn what Aristotle thought, but to live better</li>
<li>Who can benefit from such study? Those who have life experience and are basically good</li>
<li>But there are difficulties...</li>
<li>1. Few people today can read ancient Greek, so we mostly depend on translators (and translators are notoriously unreliable)</li>
<li>2. Aristotle's popular works did not survive the collapse of classical civilization; we are left with this more scholarly works, which are not easy to read</li>
<li>3. Aristotle's writings on the good life are not fully consistent: there are subtle and not-so-subtle differences among Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, Eudemian Ethics, and Politics</li>
<li>4. Ancient Greek society is quite foreign to us (for instance, their economy was based on slavery and they had little respect for craftsmanship or productive work)</li>
<li>5. Aristotle's philosophical assumptions are very different from ours (for instance, he did not believe in duty and sin and other post-Christian concepts, nor even in morality or ethics in the modern sense of rule-bound constraints on action)</li>
<li>Instead, he considered ethics to be the art of character and personal excellence, and his ethical writings are focused on one core concept: eudaimonia</li>
<li>Although the term is often translated as "happiness", it is much more than just a feeling</li>
<li>Eudaimonia is practical, rational activity grounded in excellence of character and decision-making</li>
<li>Another way to look at it: eudaimonia is an enjoyable combination of eupraxia (successful action) and euboulia (successful reflection)</li>
<li>Thus eudaimonia is a matter of actualizing your potential: it is an achievement, a completion or perfection of human nature - like hitting the target (skopos) in archery or reaching the finish line (telos) in a footrace</li>
<li>Successful living is not merely good, but also beautifully right</li>
<li>It's true that the experience of successful living is enjoyable, but this enjoyment is grounded in human nature and the circumstances and singularity of your own life</li>
<li>What are the causes of success or failure in both action and reflection? Aristotle discusses the relative roles of nature, nurture, and choice (which open up big questions of personal responsibility!), but he lacked scientific knowledge of the relevant biological and psychological factors - not that we moderns fully understand these matters yet, either</li>
<li>According to Aristotle, there are several ways to go astray or miss the target in life...</li>
<li>1. As a simple matter of biology, a few people utterly lack the capacity for forethought and reflection, and thus are limited to a kind of animal existence</li> 
<li>2. Altogether the worst are people who, whether through upbringing or choice, experience a thorough corruption of character (mochtheria) and thus pursue bad and repulsively wrong (as opposed to good and beautifully right) goals in life and who do so without regrets or remorse</li>
<li>3. Less imperfect are those who understand what's good, but who lack the self-restraint to do the right thing because they are swayed by unnatural or unbounded impulses and desires for wealth, fame, power, or unworthy pleasures; these impulsive people (akrates) have regrets, but nevertheless they cannot help themselves; we might call them self-indulgent except they indulge their lower selves and are not true to their higher potential</li>
<li>4. Better than such people are those who do what is good despite having the same sorts of impulses and desires; such people reluctantly or even heroically exercise self-restraint (enkrateia), but doing so is painful and thus they do not fully enjoy life or live up to the highest human potential</li>
<li>By contrast, those who live most successfully (eupraxia) and truly thrive (aretao) do what is good because it is beautifully right (kalos), they do not have unnatural or unworthy impulses and desires in the first place, they experience inner harmony, and they enjoy life to the fullest. This is true and lasting eudaimonia.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lecture 2: Relationships and Community</h3>
<ul>
<li>Human beings as "social" or "political" animals - what does this mean?</li>
<li>A person is born into and raised by a family</li>
<li>Individuals and families are embedded in a community (polis)</li>
<li>The purpose of the community (and the family) is the excellence of the individuals comprising it</li>
<li>At the same time, the excellence of the individual in large measure consists of activities that support the family and community: bravery to defend the community, moderation to preserve family relationships, etc.</li>
<li>For Aristotle, the individual, the family, and the community have a symbiotic relationship</li>
<li>The Greek word philia (usually translated as "friendship") covers a wide range of personal relationships: parental care, sibling devotion, marital partnership, chosen friendships, business interactions, civic benevolence, etc.</li>
<li>Aristotle uncovers three different foundations for personal relationships: enjoyment, usefulness, and excellence of character</li>
<li>Relationships among children and young adults are usually based on enjoyment because their characters are not yet well formed</li>
<li>Business and community relationships are based on usefulness</li>
<li>Chosen friendships can be based on all three factors, but the most valuable relationships are based on excellence of character</li>
<li>Philia vs. eros as character vs. usefulness</li>
<li>Unequal relationships (parent-child, teacher-student, etc.)</li>
<li>Marriage as a partnership, both ancient and modern (plus: the status of women in ancient society); what is Aristotle's settled view and can it be updated to reflect modern reality?</li>
<li>Love of self in Aristotle - are you your own best friend?</li>
<li>A friend as "another self"</li>
<li>Relationships as a source of self-knowledge and self-improvement</li>
<li>Friendship as a shared project</li>
<li>Modern individualism vs. ancient ways of life</li>
<li>Bridging the gap between "individualism" and "altruism"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lecture 3: Character</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ethics is the art of character (ethos), not a rigid code of moral rules as in Christianity or modern ethics</li>
<li>Arete is not "virtue" but excellence or thriving (cf. Homeric Greek verb aretao = to thrive or prosper)</li>
<li>That is: doing a great job of performing the primary tasks of a human being</li>
<li>Or: keeping your soul in great shape</li>
<li>The four aretai in ancient Greek thought: courage, moderation, justice, wisdom (and often piety)</li>
<li>Aristotleâ€™s expanded list: generosity, benevolence, etc.</li>
<li>Aristotle's list of aretai reflects the deeply social nature of personal interactions in ancient Greek communities</li>
<li>But modern society is very different from ancient society</li>
<li>Modern excellences include qualities related to work (productiveness), the struggle for financial independence (frugality), wider notions of courage, etc.</li>
<li>Not just acting appropriately but also reacting appropriately; excellence of character involves feeling and emotion</li>
<li>Differing motivations for good action (avoidance of punishment, shame, decency, love of honor, doing what is beautifully right)</li>
<li>An in-depth exploration of courage as an example of motivations for good action</li>
<li>The highest intention is taking action for the sake of what is beautifully right (kalos)</li>
<li>Doing what is beautifully right and fitting for the occasion and in a particular context</li>
<li>The reason that going astray is not right or fitting is because it veers mindlessly toward acting or reacting too much or too little</li>
<li>Excellence of character is a mindful balance - a midpoint between too much and too little</li>
<li>Yet overdoing it or underdoing it is a matter of missing the mark - not of sinning (which is a post-Aristotelian, Christian concept)</li>
<li>Thus there is always a continuum of behavior: not black and white, not good and evil, but more or less on target in accordance with the particulars of time and place and context</li>
<li>Going astray is usually a matter of being lured by pleasure, of avoiding pain, of succumbing to fear, of giving in to desire, etc.</li>
<li>Example: various ways of straying from frugality</li>
<li>Learning to be good - the roles of education, training, upbringing, etc.</li>
<li>Excellence of character as a mindful practice, not a mindless "habit"</li>
<li>What kind of knowledge is involved in mindful practice?</li>
<li>The integration of character and thought</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lecture 4: Thought and Choice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Human beings as rational animals</li>
<li>Logos as reason-and-speech</li>
<li>This too is social: learning to speak correctly and learning to act and react correctly both happen in a human context of family and community</li>
<li>Practical wisdom as excellence of thinking and choosing</li>
<li>Orthos logos as "straight thinking"</li>
<li>Orthos orexis as "straight reaching"</li>
<li>What is within the scope of human choice and decision?</li>
<li>Choice as desiderative desire or charged thinking</li>
<li>Here again, pleasure and pain can lead you astray</li>
<li>Balance revisited: choice as a way to guide or counteract your impulses</li>
<li>Choice is contextual and involves insight into particulars</li>
<li>There are no hard-and-fast rules for excellent choice (euboulia) and excellent conduct (eupraxia)</li>
<li>Yet persuasion and counsel play a major role, especially from family, friends, and community</li>
<li>Two aspects of reason: directing and listening</li>
<li>Listening to external guidance</li>
<li>Internalizing external guidance</li>
<li>Guiding yourself</li>
<li>Self-direction as a measure of maturity: reflection as taking counsel with yourself</li>
<li>Applying Aristotelian dialectic to significant decisions (philosophical practice)...</li>
<li>1. reaching an impasse (aporia)</li>
<li>2. asking the right questions</li>
<li>3. understanding the concrete situation</li>
<li>4. analyzing your options</li>
<li>5. synthesizing your insights and values</li>
<li>6. making a choice / coming up with a plan</li>
<li>Once you have made choices and plans, action is not mindless but neither does it require that level of deep reflection</li>
<li>Seeing things through: impulsiveness (akrasia) revisited, or why do some people not do what they understand to be best?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lecture 5 - Crafting a Life</h3>
<ul>
<li>What makes a suitable goal (telos) for life?</li>
<li>Preconditions for eudaimonia (e.g., health) vs. eudaimonia itself</li>
<li>Wealth, fame, power (etc.) as inherently unbounded, unnatural, and unstable</li>
<li>Excellence of character and thought are natural activities, actualizations of human potential</li>
<li>Unleisured activity exists for the sake of leisured activity</li>
<li>Work, play, and serious leisure</li>
<li>What free people do: learning, inquiry, culture, philia, etc.</li>
<li>Enjoyment of free activity</li>
<li>The philanthropic life</li>
<li>The life of inquiry</li>
<li>Divine activity as a model for human activity?</li>
<li>The differing perspectives of the Nicomachean Ethics and Eudemian Ethics: divine excellence vs. complete human excellence (kalokagathia)</li>
<li>Sagacity vs. wisdom</li>
<li>What is Aristotle's settled view?</li>
<li>Hitting the target is not just a matter of succeeding temporarily or in one area of life, but of crafting a life worth living</li>
<li>Aristotle's "three lives" of pleasure, community involvement, and intellectual inquiry: a thought experiment about how you would structure your life if you didn't have to work</li>
<li>In modern times, there are other lives we consider worth living, such as professional achievement and artistic creativity - how do they fit into an Aristotelian perspective and why did Aristotle not consider them?</li>
<li>Do the "three lives" make sense in the modern world?</li>
<li>Does your life need one central task or focus?</li>
<li>Cultivating multiple fields of endeavor: vitality, love, achievement, beauty, wisdom, character</li>
<li>A "portfolio management" approach to thriving as a human being</li>
<li>Crafting a life</li>

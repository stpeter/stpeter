<h1>Lecture Course: Aristotle on Living Well</h1>

<p>Last Updated: 2019-07-13</p>

<p><em>An experimental outline for a lecture course about Aristotle's views on the good life.</em></p>

<h3>LECTURE 1 - eudaimonia</h3>
<ul>
<li>About me</li>
<li>About you</li>
<li>About Aristotle</li>
<li>Why study Aristotle's writings on ethics? Not to learn what Aristotle wrote, but to live better</li>
<li>Who can benefit? Those who have life experience and are basically good</li>
<li>But there are difficulties: the ancient Greek language, Aristotle's dense style, the extremely foreign culture of ancient Greece, the pre-Christian presuppositions of Aristotle's philosophy</li>
<li>Furthermore, our source materials are not consistent - there are subtle and not-so-subtle differences among Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, Eudemian Ethics, and Politics</li>
<li>Yet all of these books are focused on one core concept: eudaimonia</li>
<li>Although the term is often translated as "happiness", it is much more than just a feeling</li>
<li>Eudaimonia is practical, rational activity grounded in excellence of character and decision-making</li>
<li>Another way to look at it: eudaimonia is an enjoyable combination of eupraxia (successful action) and euboulia (successful reflection)</li>
<li>Thus eudaimonia is a matter of actualizing your potential: it is an achievement, a completion or perfection of human nature - like hitting the bull's eye in archery</li>
<li>It's true that this experience is enjoyable, but the enjoyment is grounded in human nature and the circumstances and singularity of your own life</li>
<li>However, there are several ways to go astray or miss the target: total corruption of character (pursuing bad and wrong goals in life), impulsiveness (knowing what's right and good but not doing it), even mere self-control (doing what's right and good but doing so reluctantly or painfully)</li>
<li>What are the causes or success or failure in both action and reflection? Nature, nurture, and choice (this opens up big questions of personal responsibility!)</li>
</ul>

<h3>LECTURE 2 - relationships</h3>
<ul>
<li>Human beings as social animals</li>
<li>Philia (usually translated as "friendship") covers a wide range of personal relationships, from parental love to chosen friendships to business interactions to civic benevolence</li>
<li>Aristotle uncovers three different foundations for personal relationships: enjoyment vs. personal gain vs. excellence of character</li>
<li>Marriage: ancient and modern (plus: the status of women in ancient society)</li>
<li>Philia vs. eros</li>
<li>Close, chosen friendships</li>
<li>Child rearing, family, parental love</li>
<li>Community (civic friendship)</li>
<li>Love of self in Aristotle - are you your own best friend?</li>
<li>A friend as another self</li>
<li>Relationships as a source of self-knowledge</li>
<li>Modern individualism vs. ancient ways of life</li>
<li>Bridging the gap between individualism and altruism</li>
</ul>

<h3>LECTURE 3 - character</h3>
<ul>
<li>For Aristotle, ethics is the art of character (ethos), not a code of moral rules as in Christianity or modern ethics</li>
<li>For Aristotle, arete is not "virtue" but excellence or thriving</li>
<li>The four aretai in ancient Greek thought: courage, moderation, justice, wisdom (and often piety)</li>
<li>Aristotleâ€™s expanded list: generosity, benevolence, etc.</li>
<li>Not just acting appropriately but also reacting appropriately; excellence of character involves feeling and emotion</li>
<li>And there are differing motivations for good action (avoidance of punishment, shame, decency, love of honor, doing what is beautifully right): the example of courage</li>
<li>The highest intention is taking action for the sake of what is beautifully right (kalos)</li>
<li>Doing what is beautifully right and fitting for the occasion and in a particular context</li>
<li>Going astray is not right or fitting because it veers mindlessly toward one extreme or another</li>
<li>Excellence of character is a mindful balance between these extremes</li>
<li>Yet these extremes are a matter of missing the mark - not of sinning (a post-Aristotelian, Christian concept)</li>
<li>Thus there is always a spectrum of behavior: not black and white, not good and evil, but more or less on target</li>
<li>Going astray is usually a matter of being lured by pleasure or of avoiding pain</li>
<li>Aristotle's list of aretai reflects the deeply social nature of personal interactions in ancient Greek communities</li>
<li>But modern society is very different</li>
<li>Modern excellences includes excellences like productiveness and frugality, wider notions of courage, etc.</li>
<li>What is involved in becoming good? Education, training, upbringing</li>
<li>Mindful practice, not mindless habit</li>
<li>Excellence as an integration of character and thought</li>
</ul>

<h3>LECTURE 4 - thought and choice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Human beings as rational animals: one is best led by the part of one's person that "has reason", with the part that "listens to reason" following</li>
<li>Logos as reason-and-speech (but this too is social: learning to speak correctly and learning to act and react correctly both happen in a human context of family and community)</li>
<li>Practical wisdom as excellence of thinking and choosing</li>
<li>Orthos logos as "straight thinking"</li>
<li>Orthos orexis as "straight reaching"</li>
<li>Choice as desiderative desire or charged thinking</li>
<li>Here again, pleasure and pain can lead you astray</li>
<li>Balance revisited: choice as a way to guide or counteract your impulses</li>
<li>These matters are contextual; choice involves insight into particulars</li>
<li>There are no hard-and-fast rules for excellent choice (euboulia) and excellent conduct (eupraxia)</li>
<li>Yet persuasion and counsel play a major role, especially from family, friends, and community</li>
<li>In maturity, you engage in reflection, i.e., taking counsel with yourself</li>
<li>Applying Aristotelian dialectic to large decisions (philosophical practice)...</li>
<li>1. reaching an impasse</li>
<li>2. asking the right questions</li>
<li>3. understanding the concrete situation</li>
<li>4. analyzing your options</li>
<li>5. synthesizing your insights and values</li>
<li>6. making a choice / coming up with a plan</li>
<li>Once you have made choices and plans, action is not mindless but it does not require such deep reflection</li>
</ul>

<h3>LECTURE 5 - crafting a life</h3>
<ul>
<li>What makes a suitable goal (telos) for life?</li>
<li>Preconditions for eudaimonia (e.g., health) vs. eudaimonia itself</li>
<li>Wealth, fame, power (etc.) as inherently unbounded, unnatural, and unstable</li>
<li>Excellence of character and thought are natural activities</li>
<li>Unleisured activity exists for the sake of leisured activity</li>
<li>Work, play, and serious leisure</li>
<li>What free people do: learning, culture, friendship, etc.</li>
<li>Enjoyment of free activity</li>
<li>The philanthropic life</li>
<li>The love of wisdom</li>
<li>Divine activity as a model for human activity?</li>
<li>Sagacity and the life of the mind</li>
<li>The differing perspectives of the Nicomachean Ethics and Eudemian Ethics</li>
<li>What is Aristotle's settled view?</li>
<li>The life of complete excellence: kalokagathia in the Eudemian Ethics as "the right and the good"</li>
<li>Hitting the target is not just a matter of succeeding temporarily or in one area of life, but of crafting a life worth living</li>
<li>Aristotle's "three lives" of pleasure, community involvement, and intellectual inquiry: a thought experiment about how you'd structure your life if you didn't have to work</li>
<li>In modern times, there are other lives we consider worth living, such as professional achievement and artistic creativity - how do they fit into an Aristotelian perspective and why did Aristotle not consider them?</li>
<li>Do the "three lives" make sense in the modern world?</li>
<li>Does your life need one central task or focus?</li>
<li>Maintaining multiple areas of focus</li>
<li>A "portfolio management" approach to thriving as a human being</li>
<li>Crafting a life</li>
</ul>

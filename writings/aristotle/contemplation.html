<p>The role of θεωρία (commonly translated as contemplation) in Aristotle's ethical theory has long been a matter of keen dispute. In this paper I compare and contrast θεωρία with πρᾶξις and connect both concepts with ἐνέργεια to cast θεωρία in a new light.</p>

<h3>I. Fields of Meaning</h3>

<p>As Aryeh Kosman observes in a discussion of ἐνέργεια [note], a word from ancient Greek does not necessarily map exactly to a word in modern English; each word is used to cover a field of meaning, and the fields might not overlap. This is definitely true with the θεωρία-contemplation mapping.</p>
<p>First, consider that the earliest use, and for centuries the most common use, of the term contemplation in English referred to religious musing and devout meditation in the context of Christianity; similarly, the contemplative life was one given up to religious contemplation and prayer to the Christian God, especially in the spirit of the Middle Ages. (OED, s.v.) Aristotle preceded Christianity by centuries, of course, and he never mentions prayer or religious devotion in the context of θεωρία. Therefore on the face of it we cannot safely assume that θεωρία always or ever means for Aristotle precisely what contemplation means for us.</p>
<p>Second, some uses of θεωρία and θεωρεῖν (and cognates) seem to be located outside the field we're accustomed to. For instance, at EE V.5 (EN VI.5) 1040b7-10 Aristotle mentions that the Athenian statesman Pericles excelled at θεωρία. More substantively and as I shall discuss at greater length below, at two points in his discussion of ἀκρασία (1146b31-35 and 1153a20-23) Aristotle seems to use θεωρεῖν to mean something close to "be aware of" or "keep in mind" (Irwin translates as "attend to").</p>
<p>Third, although θεωρητικός is often translated as "theoretical", the connection between theory (e.g., a modern scientific theory) and contemplation is far from clear; indeed, we would normally consider science to be diametrically opposed to the religious attitude that suffused the contemplative life in the Middle Ages. Furthermore, it can be dangerous to merely transliterate an ancient Greek word into a current English word that re-uses the Greek root (for example, would we translate ἐνέργεια as energy?).</p>
<p>For these reasons among others, it behooves us to approach θεωρία afresh, free from the Latinate and Christian overtones that the concept of contemplation has accreted over the last thousand years or more.</p>

<h2>Nature's Imperative</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
Just as the poet freely yokes his thoughts<br/>
To the tyranny of rhythm and rhyme,<br/>
You must obey what's best for a long time<br/>
Or you will lose respect for what you ought:
</p>
<p>
Your higher self, transfigured and refined.<br/>
Subjecting your freedom and inner strength<br/>
To ever higher laws turns you at length<br/>
Into creature and creator combined.
</p>
<p>
The paradox that order makes you free<br/>
Leads roundabout to everything of worth:<br/>
Art, virtue, reason, mastery of earth<br/>
And self, the discipline to clearly see.
</p>
<p>
The deep constraints you choose to cultivate<br/>
Make possible your drive for something great.
</p>

<h2>A Note to the Reader</h2>
<p>As is true of aphorisms (see Nietzsche's preface to On the Genealogy of Morals), so also of poems: they require exegesis. Because these poems were inspired by my encounter with Nietzsche's works, to understand this cycle it's helpful to read the passages referenced at the bottom of each page. Even better, read his books, preferably in chronological order:</p>
<ul>
<li>1872 &mdash; <cite>The Birth of Tragedy</cite></li>
<li>1876 &mdash; <cite>Untimely Meditations</cite></li>
<li>1878 &mdash; Volume I of <cite>Human, All Too Human</cite></li>
<li>1879 &mdash; Volume II, Part I of <cite>Human, All Too Human</cite></li>
<li>1880 &mdash; Volume II, Part II of <cite>Human, All Too Human</cite></li>
<li>1881 &mdash; <cite>Daybreak</cite></li>
<li>1882 &mdash; Books I-IV of <cite>The Joyful Learning</cite>*</li>
<li>1883 &mdash; Parts I &amp; II of <cite>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</cite></li>
<li>1884 &mdash; Part III of <cite>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</cite></li>
<li>1885 &mdash; Part IV of <cite>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</cite></li>
<li>1886 &mdash; <cite>Beyond Good and Evil</cite></li>
<li>1887 &mdash; Book V of <cite>The Joyful Learning</cite>, with an Appendix of Songs; <cite>On the Genealogy of Morals</cite></li>
<li>1888 &mdash; <cite>The Case of Wagner</cite>; <cite>Twilight of the Idols</cite>; <cite>The Anti-Christ</cite>; <cite>Ecce Homo</cite></li>
</ul>
<p>Although his letters and notebooks can yield helpful insights, for me the books he completed take precedence.</p>
<p>The poems in this book are my own compositions, except for translations of the following poems by Nietzsche himself: "My Happiness", "For Dancers", "Upwards", "Narrow Souls", "Interpretation", "Without Envy", "Acclaim", "Ecce Homo", and "Toward New Seas" (printed in italics within the text).</p>

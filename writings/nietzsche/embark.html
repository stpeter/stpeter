<h2>Embark!</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
The moral world is also round
And has its varied continents:
What makes a soul or body sound
Is found through wide experiments.
</p>
<p>
The temper of your local shores
And pleasure of your nearest sands
Much differs from the far Azores
And what is prized in distant lands.
</p>
<p>
Slip the moors and set your course
For explorations far from home:
Try many ways without remorse
And find your treasure as you roam.

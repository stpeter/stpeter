<h2>The Work of the Soul</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
What in the end is being wise<br/>
But virtue in the ancient sense:<br/>
The strength of mind to supervise<br/>
Emotion and the future tense
</p>
<p>
Of how you think and choose and act,<br/>
The willingess to judicate<br/>
Between the claims of wish and fact,<br/>
And thus to mold and shape your fate.
</p>
<p>
This height's not easy to achieve,<br/>
So you might seek a shorter path<br/>
In god or faith - might self-deceive<br/>
And try to cheat the brutal math
</p>
<p>
Of greater work and countless hours<br/>
Of practicing in depth and length<br/>
The cultivation of your powers<br/>
Of self-command and moral strength.
</p>
<p>
The inner beauty you refine<br/>
Through harmony of task and soul<br/>
Demands your best as you define<br/>
And represent your highest goal.

<h2>Vivo, Ergo Cogito</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
Perhaps there is a greater fame<br/>
Than that attained by mere acclaim:<br/>
The glory of a higher goal,<br/>
The image of your deepest soul
</p>
<p>
Imprinted in a work or act;<br/>
Creation made a living fact,<br/>
Insight deep or deeply rare,<br/>
A greatness that you greatly share
</p>
<p>
Across the all too human ages<br/>
And with the all too human sages.<br/>
Guard your hopes in all you strive<br/>
To make, fully green and all alive:
</p>
<p>
Life itself, the craft you ply -<br/>
If you learn to trust your eye<br/>
And ear, to seize what's near,<br/>
To honor what you consider dear -
</p>
<p>
Is glorious enough in scope<br/>
To fulfill your highest hope.<br/>
Enforce within this law severe:<br/>
Think and live what you revere.
</p>

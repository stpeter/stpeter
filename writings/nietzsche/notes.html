<h2>Notes Toward Songs of Zarathustra</h2>

<h3>Schopenhauer as Educator</h3>
<p>Education and philosophy for life - to be a free person, to cultivate and liberate yourself, to follow your genius, to be unconditionally honest and simple and true in thought and life, to be beautifully consistent in your uniqueness, to live according to your own laws and standards, to be responsible to yourself, to be the true helmsman of your existence, to honor what you have truly loved and revered, what has borne your soul aloft into its higher nature.</p>
<p>To be an example in your outward life, in how you bear yourself, how you dress, how you eat, how you speak - in all the practicalities of living - to live a visible philosophical life.</p>
<p>How to derive a circle of duties and a flow of life from this ideal? Promote the philosopher and artist and saint within yourself, and also in others. Set yourself goals that transcend money-making, service to state and society, superficial beauty or conventional virtue or dry knowledge. Cultivate wisdom, holiness, love, and longing for what is best and rare and great and uncommon in human existence. To live in accordance with and for the sake of this outer and inner philosophical life. Not the platitudes of ethics, but its living, heroic reality, informing all your deeds and pursuits.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>
Redemption through a savior, thinker, artist, saint,<br/>
Betrays the principle of life and has the taint<br/>
Of laziness in cultivation of my mind<br/>
And soul. The goal, instead, is actively to bind
</p>
<p>
Myself to higher laws and to define my duties<br/>
Of honesty and truth, thus making real the beauties<br/>
Of consonance in life between ideal and deed.<br/>
The longing for what's excellent and rare will lead
</p>
<p>
Me to a path that only I can walk, a span<br/>
That only I can cross. The station that I man<br/>
Is savior of myself alone. [...]<br/>

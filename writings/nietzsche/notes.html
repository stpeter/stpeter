<h2>Notes Toward Songs of Zarathustra</h2>

<!--<p>[nothing here right now]</p>-->

<h3>The Will to Power</h3>
<p>
The will for man and earth lacks nothing<br/>
We need no above or beyond, no world outside *our* world of life, nature, history<br/>
A strong spirit that works and thinks and feels honestly, with inner necessity, with deep personal choice, with joy<br/>
Such a spirit needs no ideal, nothing "higher"<br/>
The overflowing energy and certainty of life itself<br/>
The self-affirmation and self-justification of man, a confidence in the dignity and uniqueness and irreplaceability of humankind<br/>
Love of the human, animal, material<br/>
Pleasure in the senses and in our reasoning powers<br/>
Attraction to joy and beauty<br/>
A longing to get closer to appearance, change, becoming, growth, to the very fact of longing<br/>
Acceptance of the most fundamental presuppositions of life<br/>
A will to being, to life, to growth, to power<br/>
That which preserves, enhances, conditions, transfigures, intensifies, affirms, justifies the ascending movement of life<br/>
But we need a goal, a will, an ideal to oppose the ascetic ideal (kind of philosophical arms race)<br/>
The life of man on this earth, the individual who is a completion of mankind, is the meaning, the justification, the independent value, the way, the means, the goal<br/>
Devise your own virtue, your own duty, your own categorical imperative

<h2>Notes Toward Songs of Zarathustra</h2>

<!--<p>[nothing here right now]</p>-->

<h3>Midnight Song</h3>

<ul>
<li>Solitude, and a homecoming in solitude, blissful and tender and still</li>
<li>Inquiring, seeking, overcoming</li>
<li>Something unquenched and unquenchable is in me</li>
<li>It is night and I am light</li>
<li>The fountains of delight speak louder</li>
<li>Alone I live in my own light</li>
<li>Giving, not receiving</li>
<li>The moon's love affair: pale, pure, reflected love in knowledge only, not golden and warming and blessing like the light of the sun</li>
<li>The insubstantial images and gods and overmen of the poets - pale and wraithlike compared to life itself</li>
<li>The dew falls on the grass when the night is most silent</li>
<li>A realization that you experience only yourself</li>
<li>Treading your path of greatness</li>
<li>Climbing above yourself</li>
<li>Luminous sky, stars, wisdom - cold and pale but above the clouds of confusion and a sacred No - instead a Yes and Amen</li>
<li>The bell rings twelve times, and one thinks of leaving life - but life knows that one loves her more than wisdom</li>
<li>Pain is also joy, a curse is also a blessing, the night is also a sun, midnight is also a noon</li>
</ul>

<p>At midnight comes a second noon,<br/>
When time again stands still.</p>

<h3>The Dawn</h3>

<ul>
<li>Between dawn and dawn comes a new truth</li>
<li>Working and making company with those who create and harvest and rejoice</li>
<li>Begetters and culivators and sowers of the future</li>
<li>Loving the earth as a creator and begetter</li>
<li>A new morning, a new nobility</li>
<li>This is my day, my dawn - rise up!</li>
<li>Joy at a new existence</li>
<li>The will as its own redeemer and bringer of joy</li>
<li>Every soul is a world of its own</li>
<li>Forming the world in your image by your reason, will, and love</li>
<li>Your work, your will, your love</li>
<li>To step beyond what has been merely human until now</li>
<li>BGE 271: an ardor and thirst that drives the soul out of night into morning, out of gloom into brightness, a noble inclination toward what is glittering, profound, refined</li>
<li>The glowing love of the sun at dawn</li>
<li>Sun-love as innocence and creative desire</li>
<li>Not wisdom but life</li>
<li>A little wisdom is possible, but only a little!</li>
<li>There is too much of chance in life to gain much certainty - this in itself brings a happy certainty, to dance on feet of chance</li>
<li>To learn and know only for the sake of creating</li>
<li>Offering the honey of wisdom for the sake of your work - casting your happiness as a lure for others</li>
<li>Affirmation of life despite its pains</li>
</ul>

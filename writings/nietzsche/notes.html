<h3>On history and life...</h3>
<p>Perhaps fame is not always petty. In <cite>On the Use and Disadvantage of History for Life</cite>, Nietzsche writes that there is a transfigured form of fame which is something more than the tastiest morsel of egotism (Schopenhauer), but instead is a feeling that the life of man is a glorious thing, and a belief in the solidarity and continuity of greatness across all the ages of human history. This is the fame that comes from a work, an act, a piece of rare enlightenment, a creation - the monogram of your most essential being, which means even more than your own existence.</p>
<p>Such can be your fame if you look ahead and set yourself a great goal, an aim, a high and noble end; if you draw about you the fence of a great and comprehensive hope, of a hope-filled striving.</p>
<p>One such end is to live as a free, cultivated human being, to treat life itself as a craft that must be learned from the ground up and practiced remorselessly, to fulfill the philosophical law in yourself by experimenting with how to live. This is achieved by living a full, green life: through right and simple seeing and hearing, through happily seizing what is nearest and most natural to you, trusting your feelings and experiences and then your resultant thoughts. Vivo, ergo cogito: I live, therefore I think.</p>

<h3>Vivo, Ergo Cogito</h3>
<p>
Perhaps there is a greater fame<br/>
Than that attained by mere acclaim:<br/>
The glory of a higher goal,<br/>
The image of your deepest soul
</p>
<p>
Imprinted in a work or act;<br/>
Creation made a living fact,<br/>
Insight deep or deeply rare,<br/>
A greatness that you greatly share
</p>
<p>
Across the all too human ages<br/>
And with the all too human sages.<br/>
Guard your hopes in all you strive<br/>
To make, fully green and all alive.
</p>
<p>
Life itself, the craft you ply -<br/>
If you learn to trust your eye<br/>
And ear, to seize what's near,<br/>
To honor what you consider dear -
</p>
<p>
Is glorious enough in scope<br/>
To fulfill your highest hope.<br/>
Enforce within this law severe:<br/>
Think and live what you revere.

<h2>Notes Toward Songs of Zarathustra</h2>

<p>
You say you know which course is best?<br/>
Then let us put it to the test!<br/>
The action will prove false or true<br/>
If we but give the trial its due.<br/>
But if you say experiment<br/>
Won't yield an answer, then we've spent<br/>
Our energy on fruitless chatter<br/>
That never can decide the matter.

<p>
I look back gently on the time<br/>
    When I had every answer.<br/>
From there I've made a steady climb,<br/>
    Light-footed as a dancer,<br/>
On mountain paths toward starry heights<br/>
    Where certainties are few.<br/>
The perils of these lonely flights<br/>
    Will yield up what is true.

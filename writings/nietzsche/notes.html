<h2>Notes Toward Songs of Zarathustra</h2>

<!--<p>[nothing here right now]</p>-->

<h3>Aubade</h3>

<ul>
<li>Awakening to life</li>
<li>Enlightenment</li>
<li>Planting the seed of your highest hope (cf twilight)</li>
<li>A new beginning</li>
<li>Creating new values (cf Dawn)</li>
<li>Creating freedom</li>
<li>A sacred Yes</li>
<li>Honesty as the youngest virtue</li>
<li>Purity and cleanliness of the body</li>
<li>The body as a great intelligence</li>
<li>Not saying I but performing I</li>
<li>Creating beyond yourself</li>
<li>Purify yourself, even if you are a free spirit</li>
<li>Keep holy your highest hope</li>
<li>The earth remains free for great souls</li>
<li>Greatness is individual creativity</li>
<li>Creation as seeking a way to yourself</li>
<li>The individual is the latest, best creation</li>
<li>Consecrating the I</li>
<li>A new strength, a new right</li>
<li>A first motion, a self-propelling wheel</li>
<li>Your own will as a law above your soul</li>
<li>Mystery before noon</li>
<li>Morning dream and awakening day-wisdom: weighing the world in a pair scales - a good, human thing is the world, a garden of joy, an earthly heavens</li>
<li>The self-rejoicing soul - a sound and healthy selfishness - to love oneself with a sound and healthy love</li>
<li>Banishing all that is low and contemptible, all worrying and sighing and complaining</li>
<li>Not a commandment but a fine, subtle, patient art</li>
<li>To wait for yourself and your own way</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Great Noon</h3>

<ul>
<li>Remaining true to the earth</li>
<li>Not seeking first beyond the stars</li>
<li>Creating meaning for the earth</li>
<li>Living for knowledge</li>
<li>Working and inventing</li>
<li>Loving virtue</li>
<li>Having a deep, lavish, overfull soul</li>
<li>Justifying the men of the future</li>
<li>Having a free spirit and a free heart</li>
<li>Pride and wisdom (eagle and serpent)</li>
<li>Being halfway between animal and the more-than-human</li>
<li>Halfway on a journey through evening to a new morning</li>
<li>The sun of knowledge stands still at noon</li>
<li>A moment out of time</li>
<li>The summer solstice of the day</li>
<li>A way to a new dawn</li>
<li>Being ready and ripe</li>
<li>The world become perfect, the world itself grown ripe</li>
<li>Resting close to the earth - faithful, trusting, waiting - fastened by the finest threads</li>
<li>The best happiness comes from the smallest, gentlest, lightest things</li>
<li>The earth is rich in good little perfect things, in well constitued things, which teach hope and heal the heart</li>
<li>How much is still possible!</li>
<li>It is good to live on the earth, to will and love and desire the kingdom of the earth</li>
</ul>

<h3>Twilight Dance</h3>

<ul>
<li>Highest hope - the journey to a new morning</li>
<li>Life is a fountain of delight</li>
<li>Life: not unfathomable, but changeable and untamed/defiant</li>
<li>Praising life because I will, desire, love</li>
<li>Loving life but fond of wisdom</li>
<li>The two are very much alike!</li>
<li>Thirsting for wisdom but never satisfied</li>
<li>Perhaps she too is wicked and false?</li>
<li>Even though life is changeable, my will is invulnerable, unburiable, unchanging; thus do I overcome the pains of life and the death of my highest hopes</li>
<li>The inexhaustible, ever begetting life-will; a will to self-command and to not be remiss in obeying my highest commands; a will to create and procreate beyond myself; a will to higher, more distant, more manifold goals</li>
<li>Life and wisdom are the loves I choose between</li>
</ul>

<h3>Midnight Song</h3>

<ul>
<li>Solitude, and a homecoming in solitude, blissful and tender and still</li>
<li>Inquiring, seeking, overcoming</li>
<li>Something unquenched and unquenchable is in me</li>
<li>It is night and I am light</li>
<li>The fountains of delight speak louder</li>
<li>Alone I live in my own light</li>
<li>Giving, not receiving</li>
<li>The moon's love affair: pale, pure, reflected love in knowledge only, not golden and warming and blessing like the light of the sun</li>
<li>The insubstantial images and gods and overmen of the poets - pale and wraithlike compared to life itself</li>
<li>The dew falls on the grass when the night is most silent</li>
<li>A realization that you experience only yourself</li>
<li>Treading your path of greatness</li>
<li>Climbing above yourself</li>
<li>Luminous sky, stars, wisdom - cold and pale but above the clouds of confusion and a sacred No - instead a Yes and Amen</li>
<li>The bell rings twelve times, and one thinks of leaving life - but life knows that one loves her more than wisdom</li>
<li>Pain is also joy, a curse is also a blessing, the night is also a sun, midnight is also a noon</li>
</ul>

<p>At midnight comes a second noon,<br/>
When time again stands still.</p>

<h3>The Dawn</h3>

<ul>
<li>Between dawn and dawn comes a new truth</li>
<li>Working and making company with those who create and harvest and rejoice</li>
<li>Begetters and culivators and sowers of the future</li>
<li>Loving the earth as a creator and begetter</li>
<li>A new morning, a new nobility</li>
<li>This is my day, my dawn - rise up!</li>
<li>Joy at a new existence</li>
<li>The will as its own redeemer and bringer of joy</li>
<li>Every soul is a world of its own</li>
<li>Forming the world in your image by your reason, will, and love</li>
<li>Your work, your will, your love</li>
<li>To step beyond what has been merely human until now</li>
<li>BGE 271: an ardor and thirst that drives the soul out of night into morning, out of gloom into brightness, a noble inclination toward what is glittering, profound, refined</li>
<li>The glowing love of the sun at dawn</li>
<li>Sun-love as innocence and creative desire</li>
<li>Not wisdom but life</li>
<li>A little wisdom is possible, but only a little!</li>
<li>There is too much of chance in life to gain much certainty - this in itself brings a happy certainty, to dance on feet of chance</li>
<li>To learn and know only for the sake of creating</li>
<li>Offering the honey of wisdom for the sake of your work - casting your happiness as a lure for others</li>
<li>Affirmation of life despite its pains</li>
</ul>

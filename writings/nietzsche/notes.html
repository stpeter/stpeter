<h3>On history and life...</h3>
<p>Perhaps fame is not always petty. Nietzsche writes that there is a transfigured form of fame that is something more than the tastiest morself of egotism (Schopenhauer), but instead is a feeling that the life of man is a glorious thing, and a belief in the solidarity and continuity of greatness across all the ages of human history. This is the fame that comes from a work, an act, a piece of rare enlightenment, a creation - the monogram of your most essential being, which means even more than your own existence.</p>
<p>Such can be your fame if you look ahead and set yourself a great goal, an aim, a high and noble end; if you draw about you the fence of a great and comprehensive hope, of a hope-filled striving.</p>
<p>One such end is to live as a free, cultivated human being, to treat life itself as a craft that must be learned from the ground up and practiced remorselessly, to fulfill the philosophical law in yourself by experimenting with how to live. This is achieved by living a full, green life: through right and simple seeing and hearing, through happily seizing what is nearest and most natural to you, trusting your feelings and experiences and then your resultant thoughts. Vivo, ergo cogito: I live, therefore I think.</p>

<h2>Notes Toward Songs of Zarathustra</h2>

<!--<p>[nothing here right now]</p>-->

<h3>The Will to Power</h3>
<p>
The will for man and earth lacks nothing<br/>
We need no above or beyond, no world outside *our* world of life, nature, history<br/>
A strong spirit that works and thinks and feels honestly, with inner necessity, with deep personal choice, with joy<br/>
Such a spirit needs no ideal, nothing "higher"<br/>
The overflowing energy and certainty of life itself<br/>
The self-affirmation and self-justification of man, a confidence in the dignity and uniqueness and irreplaceability of humankind<br/>
Love of the human, animal, material<br/>
Pleasure in the senses and in our reasoning powers<br/>
Attraction to joy and beauty<br/>
A longing to get closer to appearance, change, becoming, growth, to the very fact of longing<br/>
Acceptance of the most fundamental presuppositions of life<br/>
A will to being, to life, to growth, to power<br/>
That which preserves, enhances, conditions, transfigures, intensifies, affirms, justifies the ascending movement of life<br/>
But we need a goal, a will, an ideal to oppose the ascetic ideal (kind of philosophical arms race)<br/>
The life of man on this earth, the individual who is a completion of mankind, is the meaning, the justification, the independent value, the way, the means, the goal<br/>
Devise your own virtue, your own duty, your own categorical imperative

<h3>The Masterpiece</h3>
<p>
The real answer to becoming what you are<br/>
Yes, you have a task, a fate, a destiny<br/>
But it must emerge<br/>
Have no notions or preconceptions about what your fate may be<br/>
Do not "know thyself" too soon, but slowly "become thyself"<br/>
Everything in your life has value in helping you become what you are - even your blunders, detours, delays, side roads and wrong roads<br/>
There is great prudence in forgetting, narrowing, even misunderstanding yourself<br/>
Keep yourself clear of all great imperatives<br/>
Then slowly and surely a great task, goal, aim, and meaning grows strong and dominant, mastering your life and self<br/>
Experience is the precondition, the long secret work and artistry of the soul<br/>
Not struggling or trying or wishing or willing or striving, but a calm sea without a ripple of desire<br/>
To wish that nothing should be other than what it is, least of all yourself<br/>
To be reality itself!

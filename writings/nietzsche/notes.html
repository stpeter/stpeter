<h2>Notes Toward Songs of Zarathustra</h2>

<h3>Ariadne's Lament</h3>
<p>Ariadne was the consort of Dionysus. She was also the "mistress of the labyrinth" in ancient Crete, at the center of which lived the dreaded Minotaur (in Crete named "Asterion" or "the starry one" - an appropriate epithet for Nietzsche). In BGE ยง295, Ariadne is present during the conversation between Nietzsche and Dionysus; she is therefore well-placed to bemoan Nietzsche's fate and reflect on his labyrinthine philosophy (but note: beware the Cretan Paradox!).</p>

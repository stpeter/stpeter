<h2>More Than Human</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
Who is this Ãœbermensch, you ask?<br/>
Let's try to bring him down to earth.<br/>
To say he has the greatest task<br/>
Or finds a way of giving birth
</p>
<p>
From chaos to a dancing star,<br/>
Unhelpfully is less than clear.<br/>
Yet we can see it isn't far<br/>
From overcoming guilt and fear
</p>
<p>
And other, all too human faults<br/>
To building up your own true soul &mdash;<br/>
To finding out a path that vaults<br/>
You ever closer to your goal.
</p>
<p>
So make yourself be something more<br/>
Than humans often deign to be;<br/>
Demand within the self-command<br/>
That turns your life to ecstasy.
</p>

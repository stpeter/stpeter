<h1>Songs of Zarathustra</h1>
<h2>Poetic Perspectives on Nietzsche's Ethics</h2>
<h2>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h2>
<p>This book will be a cycle of poems on Nietzsche's ethical philosophy, presenting my perspective that underneath all the angst and bluster he provided an inherently classical and positive approach to living.</p>
<p>Here are drafts of a few of the poems...</p>

<h3>Poets' Paradox</h3>
<p>
Hearken how he says, in verse,<br>
That the poets always lie - or worse,<br>
To their everlasting shame,<br>
That they ever vie for petty fame.
</p>
<p>
Their unbounded vanity<br>
Leads them far from piety;<br>
They live not the holy writ<br>
Whose deed is but to utter it.
</p>

<h3>Amor Fati</h3>
<p>
Whatever might unfold for me<br/>
Is not spun out by scheming Fates;<br/>
Instead it's simple destiny,<br/>
A line of life that time creates.
</p>
<p>
It's natural that I love this line,<br/>
Despite its pains and hurried pace;<br/>
Because the steps I make are mine,<br/>
I take pride in their style and grace.
</p>

<h3>Eternal Recurrence</h3>
<p>
What if<br/>
I've lived this hour, this day, this life<br/>
Before,<br/>
And I must live them yet again, not once,<br/>
But more<br/>
And more,<br/>
Until every experience repeats,<br/>
Recurs, and doubles back a million times<br/>
Or more.
</p>
<p>
A curse!<br/>
And yet if it must be, what if<br/>
I bless<br/>
This fact as much as if it were my choice,<br/>
Not less?<br/>
The less I treat necessity as fate,<br/>
The more<br/>
I love the life I live, and live the life<br/>
I bless.
</p>

<h3>Spiral</h3>
<p>
Eternal recurrence of the same<br/>
Sounds like a circle I can't escape,<br/>
The endless march of a lowly ant<br/>
On a moebius strip of grinding fate. 
</p>
<p>
And yet the notion spurs me on<br/>
To fly and soar while I have the chance,<br/>
To make my life a thing of gold<br/>
That shines out over time and space.

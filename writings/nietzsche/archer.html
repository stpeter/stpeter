<h2>The Archer</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
The archer stands to take her aim<br/>
At targets she will come to know<br/>
Completely at the end. The game<br/>
Demands of her to tense her bow
</p>
<p>
And fire repeatedly; to hone<br/>
Her skill it will require all<br/>
Her years. Experience has shown<br/>
The ease with which a soul can fall
</p>
<p>
Away from reaching to her goal:<br/>
Becoming what she is. The course<br/>
Of life will finally take its toll<br/>
Unless the soul can put in force
</p>
<p>
Her talents, into words and acts.<br/>
[...]

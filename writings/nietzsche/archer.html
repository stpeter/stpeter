<h2>The Archer</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
The archer stands to take her aim<br/>
At targets she can't come to know<br/>
Until the very end. The game<br/>
Demands of her to tense her bow<br/>
And fire repeatedly; to hone<br/>
Her skill it will require all<br/>
Her years. Experience has shown<br/>
The ease with which a soul can fall<br/>
Away from climbing to her goal:<br/>
Becoming what she is. The course<br/>
Of life will finally take its toll<br/>
Unless the soul can put in force<br/>
Her talents, into words and acts.<br/>
The habits that are here required<br/>
To make potential real will tax<br/>
The toughest virtues she's acquired:<br/>
A searching eye, an endless grit,<br/>
A boundless energy that tries<br/>
Whatever she must do to hit<br/>
Her highest goal before she dies.

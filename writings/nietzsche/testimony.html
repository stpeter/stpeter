<h2>The Testimony of Dionysus</h2>
<h3>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h3>
<p>
Although it's true he was the finest student that I taught,<br/>
His claim to be my best disciple doesn't square with facts<br/>
I can't ignore: he sought his liberation in his thought;<br/>
To him philosophy was like a Cretan double axe
</p>
<p>
He used to sacrifice the states my worshippers held dear;<br/>
You'd think perhaps he was a loyal student of Apollo<br/>
Because of how he sublimated everything that's near;<br/>
He made a synthesis so singular it's hard to follow.
</p>
<p>
And yet the very challenge that he sought through integration<br/>
Of the elements of dark and light within the soul<br/>
Provide a model for a life of human elevation<br/>
And point toward achievement of each person's highest goal.
</p>

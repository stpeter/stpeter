<h2>At the Feet of Dionysus</h2>
<p>
I am the last disciple of<br/>
This hidden, tempter god,<br/>
Whose unknown teachings rise above<br/>
The common road men plod
</p>
<p>
In drunk processions in his name.<br/>
He coaxes me to turn<br/>
Inward, away from petty fame;<br/>
To fire a slower burn
</p>
<p>
That grasps with lesser greed;<br/>
To still and silent lie,<br/>
So that my only, deepest need<br/>
Is mirroring the sky;
</p>
<p>
To question and to hesitate<br/>
Before I think or act.<br/>
Beneath his sway I liberate<br/>
My will and keep intact
</p>
<p>
My unnamed hopes and energy &mdash;<br/>
I'm richer, not in things,<br/>
But in spirituality<br/>
That new and newer sings.
</p>
<p>
This unknown god delivers me<br/>
From care and pain and fear;<br/>
His intercession helps me see<br/>
His influence so near 
</p>
<p>
That I can feel it lodge within<br/>
My soul &mdash; feel it inspire<br/>
A quickening of life begin<br/>
To drive me ever higher.
</p>

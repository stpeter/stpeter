<h1>Peter Saint-Andre: Writings</h1>
<p>My main project as a writer is a series of six short books about philosophers on how to live a good life (<a href='http://tao-of-roark.com/'>The Tao of Roark</a> and <a href='/writings/epicurus/'>Letters on Happiness</a> are the first two, with books on Thoreau, Nietzsche, Aristotle, and Lao Tzu to follow). I have also written a dictionary of philosophy, a book of poems, numerous <a href='/writings/essays/'>essays</a>, and various translations from Greek, Latin, and German (not counting my <a href='/tech/'>technical publications</a>).</p>
<p>I have made all of these works available in the public domain, and have also started to publish them in paperback and ebook formats. Further information is available at the links below.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href='/writings/epicurus/'>Letters on Happiness: An Epicurean Dialogue</a> (2013)</li>
  <li><a href='http://tao-of-roark.com/'>The Tao of Roark: Variations on a Theme from Ayn Rand</a> (2012)</li>
  <li><a href='/writings/rand/'>Randian Reflections</a> (2009)</li>
  <li><a href='/writings/fire/'>Ancient Fire: Poems and Translations</a> (2000)</li>
  <li><a href='http://ismbook.com/'>The Ism Book: A Field Guide to Philosophy</a> (1996)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm currently working on four projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li><cite>The Upland Farm: Thoreau on Cultivating a Good Life</cite>, a journal of ethical reflection</li>
  <li><cite>Songs of Zarathustra: Perspectives on Nietzsche's Ethics</cite>, a cycle of philosophical poems</li>
  <li><cite>Epicurus on the Good Life</cite>, a collection of <a href='http://www.monadnock.net/epicurus/'>translations</a> from Greek and Latin</li>
  <li><cite>A Worthy Life: The Essence of Aristotle's Ethics</cite>, a brief Aristotelian commentary</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually I might also write a book about Taoism, even though I know that the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite> cannot be improved upon.</p>

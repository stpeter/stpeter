<h1>Peter Saint-Andre: Writings</h1>
<p>My main project as a writer is a suite of books on the art of living, composed as reflections on six philosophers who value reason, individuality, and freedom. To increase the challenge of writing for me and the ease and variety of reading for you, each book is less than 80 pages long and is presented in a different literary form:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href='/writings/roark/'>The Tao of Roark: Variations on a Theme from Ayn Rand</a> (2012)</li>
  <li><a href='/writings/nietzsche/'>Songs of Zarathustra: Poetic Perspectives on Nietzsche's Philosophy of Life</a> (2018)</li>
  <li><a href='/writings/aristotle/'>Complete Yourself: Aristotle on Personal Excellence</a> (in progress)</li>
  <li><a href='/writings/thoreau/'>The Upland Farm: Thoreau on Cultivating a Better Life</a> (2017)</li>
  <li><a href='/writings/epicurus/'>Letters on Happiness: An Epicurean Dialogue</a> (2013)</li>
  <li><a href='/writings/tao/'>Stories of the Way: Taoist Parables</a> (research underway)</li>
</ol>
<p>I also have in mind to write a <a href='/writings/pyrrho/'>philosophical murder mystery</a> about the ancient philosopher Pyrrho and Alexander the Great.</p>
<p>Aside from my large project on the art of living, I've also written the following books:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href='http://monadnock.net/epicurus/'>Epicurus on the Good Life: A Fresh Translation</a> (in progress)</li>
<li><a href='/writings/rand/'>Randian Reflections</a> (2009)</li>
<li><a href='/writings/fire/'>Ancient Fire: Poems and Translations</a> (2000)</li>
<li><a href='/writings/ismbook/'>The Ism Book: A Field Guide to Philosophy</a> (1996)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once in a while I also compose a stray <a href='/writings/essays/'>essay</a>, <a href='aphorisms.html'>aphorism</a>, or <a href='haiku.html'>haiku</a>.</p>
<p>I have made all of these works available in the <a href='/writings/essays/publicdomain.html'>public domain</a>, and have also published them in paperback and ebook formats via the <a href='http://www.monadnock.net/'>Monadnock Valley Press</a>.</p>

<h1>Peter Saint-Andre: Writings</h1>
<p>My main project as a writer so far is a suite of reflections on six philosophers who value reason, individuality, and freedom. To increase the challenge of writing for me and the ease and variety of reading for you, each book is less than 80 pages long and is presented in a different literary form:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href='/writings/roark/'>The Tao of Roark: Variations on a Theme from Ayn Rand</a> (2012)</li>
  <li><a href='/writings/nietzsche/'>Songs of Zarathustra: Poetic Perspectives on Nietzsche's Philosophy of Life</a> (2018)</li>
  <li><a href='/writings/aristotle/'>Complete Yourself: Aristotle on Personal Excellence</a> (in progress)</li>
  <li><a href='/writings/thoreau/'>The Upland Farm: Thoreau on Cultivating a Better Life</a> (2017)</li>
  <li><a href='/writings/epicurus/'>Letters on Happiness: An Epicurean Dialogue</a> (2013)</li>
  <li><a href='/writings/tao/'>Stories of the Way: Taoist Parables</a> (research underway)</li>
</ol>
<p>After that, I plan to write another short capstone book entitled <a href='/writings/living/'>The Art of Living</a> that integrates the lessons of those six thinkers with psychological evidence and philosophical practice.</p>
<p>I also have in mind to write a <a href='/writings/pyrrho/'>philosophical murder mystery</a> about the life of the ancient skeptical philosopher Pyrrho and the death of Alexander the Great.</p>
<p>In addition, I've written or am working on the following books:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href='http://monadnock.net/epicurus/'>Epicurus on the Good Life: A Fresh Translation</a> (in progress)</li>
<li><a href='/writings/rand/'>Randian Reflections</a> (2009)</li>
<li><a href='/writings/fire/'>Ancient Fire: Poems and Translations</a> (2000)</li>
<li><a href='/writings/ismbook/'>The Ism Book: A Field Guide to Philosophy</a> (1996)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once in a while I also compose a stray <a href='/writings/essays/'>essay</a>, <a href='aphorisms.html'>aphorism</a>, or <a href='haiku.html'>haiku</a>.</p>
<p>I have made all of these works available in the <a href='/writings/essays/publicdomain.html'>public domain</a>, and have also published them in paperback and ebook formats via the <a href='http://www.monadnock.net/'>Monadnock Valley Press</a>.</p>

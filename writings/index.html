<h1>Peter Saint-Andre: Writings</h1>
<p>Over the years I have written several books of philosophy, numerous <a href='/writings/poems/'>poems</a> and <a href='/writings/essays/'>essays</a>, and various translations from Greek, Latin, and German (not counting my <a href='/tech/'>technical publications</a>).</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href='/writings/epicurus/'>Letters on Happiness: An Epicurean Dialogue</a> (2013)</li>
  <li><a href='http://tao-of-roark.com/'>The Tao of Roark: Variations on a Theme from Ayn Rand</a> (2012)</li>
  <li><a href='/writings/rand/'>Randian Reflections</a> (2009)</li>
  <li><a href='/writings/fire/'>Ancient Fire: Poems and Translations</a> (2000)</li>
  <li><a href='http://ismbook.com/'>The Ism Book: A Field Guide to Philosophy</a> (1996)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have made all of these works available in the public domain, and have also started to publish them in paperback and ebook formats.</p>
<p>I'm currently working on three projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adding to and collecting my <a href='http://www.monadnock.net/epicurus/'>Epicurus translations</a> as a short book entitled <cite>Epicurus on the Good Life</cite></li>
  <li>Writing a cycle of philosophical poems entitled <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite></li>
  <li>Writing a fictional journal of intellectual exploration entitled <cite>Walking With Thoreau</cite></li>
</ul>
<p>After those projects are complete, I plan to translate Aristotle's <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> or at least write a short book about the Aristotelian approach to eudaimonia. Eventually I might also write a book about Taoism, although I am sure that the <cite>Tao Te Ching</cite> cannot be improved upon in that regard.</p>

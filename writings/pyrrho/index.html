<h1>Journey to the East</h1>
<h2>A Novel of Ancient Pyrrhonism</h2>
<h2>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h2>
<p>This will be a short novel about Pyrrho's journey to Central Asia and northeastern India with the army of Alexander the Great, and his journey of losing his beliefs one by one until he settles into epoche and ataraxia. So far all I've done is sketch out the merest idea of the story, and generate a large <a href='readings.html'>reading list</a> for background research.</p>

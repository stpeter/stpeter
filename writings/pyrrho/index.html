<h1>Gods Among Men</h1>
<h2>A Novel of Pyrrho and Alexander the Great</h2>
<h2>by <a href='/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h2>
<p>This will be a novel about the Greek philosopher Pyrrho's journey to India with the army of Alexander the Great, combined with a murder mystery about Alexander's death in Babylon.</p>
<p>Although Pyrrho is often considered the founder of the skeptical tradition in Western philosophy, his was a gentle form of skepticism focused on achieving serenity (ἀταραξία). According to Pyrrho, one finds such peace by being without opinions (adoxatous), being uninclined (aklineis) to one side or the other in disputes about human affairs (pragmata), and being unwavering (akradantous) in this neutral attitude. One does this by realizing that human affairs are inherently unstable or uneasy (astathmeta), unfixed or undecidable (anepikrita), and undifferentiated (adiaphora).</p>
<p>If this sound similar to Buddhism and Taoism, it might be no accident. The ancient biographer Diogenes Laertius claims that Pyrrho adopted his philosophy of ataraxia by interacting with "naked wise men" (gymnosophoi), probably near Gandhara in modern-day Pakistan. The parallels are explored in depth by Christopher Beckwith in his book <cite>Greek Buddha</cite>. Beckwith might go too far in his extrapolations from the meagre evidence that remains - in true Pyrrhonian fashion, the matter is likely undecidable - but that's why fiction is the appropriate literary form in which to search for the answers.</p>
<p>As always, my primary interest is in Pyrrhonism as a way of life.</p>
<p>If nothing in human life is perfectly satisfactory, then excessive desire causes a cycle of hope and disappointment, whereas the practice of non-desire leads to true enjoyment and authentic autonomy.</p>
<p>If nothing in human life is permanently stable and fixed, then excessive attachment to people and things causes a cycle of possession and loss, whereas the practice of non-attachment leads to true acceptance and authentic relatedness.</p>
<p>If nothing in human affairs can be precisely differentiated (including yourself), then asserting yourself causes a cycle of pride and deflation, whereas the practice of non-assertion leads to true serenity and authentic mastery.</p>
<p>The contrast with Alexander the Great is stark: a man of unbridled passions, deep attachments, and overweening ambitions who was considered a god among men. Yet Pyrrho, too, was considered a god among men for his extraordinary serenity. As with the Taoist and Buddhist sages, Pyrrho's naturalness and spontaneity came from immersing himself in the flowing stream of reality &mdash; not reaching through desire, grasping through attachment, or pushing through self-assertion.</p>
<p>Because I'm actively writing an <a href='/writings/aristotle/'>epitome of Aristotle's ethics</a>, for now I'm mostly just <a href='readings.html'>reading</a> as background research for this novel.</p>

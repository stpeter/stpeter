<p>The currently featured <a href="ism.html">ism</a> is:</p>
<blockquote class="featured"><p><a href="pyrrhonism.html">Pyrrhonism</a>: Pyrrho was a painter and poet who accompanied Alexander the Great on his Asian campaign and apparently underwent a philosophical conversion in Gandhara on the northwestern fringes of India, fueling speculation that he was influenced by early <a href="buddhism.html">Buddhism</a>. He believed that tranquility could be achieved only by steadfastly withholding judgment about ethical matters because they cannot be reliably decided as good or evil, true or false.</p></blockquote>

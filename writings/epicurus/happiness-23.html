<p>Hi Paul!</p>
<p>That insight strikes a chord with me, but then I'm a poet at heart. It does seem more emotional or spiritual than Epicurus might have been comfortable with &mdash; my impression from his fragments is that he was a bit dry in how he expressed things &mdash; but I think it's consistent with his somewhat strange ideas about pleasure and happiness.</p>
<p>I think it might be easier to capture this spiritual aspect of Epicureanism in poetry than in prose. As Lucretius wrote to start Book Five of <cite>The Nature of Things</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Who can build a fitting song, who has the strength of heart<br/>
    To match the Majesty of Things and these truths in his art? 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, throughout the centuries, numerous fine poets &mdash; Horace, Catullus, Shelley, Tennyson, Swinburne, Whitman, Dickinson, Pessoa, and of course our friend Lucretius &mdash; have been influenced by Epicurus in his emphasis on tranquility, avoiding politics, and enjoying each day. As a matter of fact, I recently noticed that the person who made the Epicurus translation we've been using has rendered some of the more Epicurean poems of Horace into English (see <a href='http://www.monadnock.net/horace/'>http://www.monadnock.net/horace/</a>). He has also written an original poem entitled "In The Garden", which captures many of the themes we've been discussing all this time. I thought I'd send it along for your enjoyment...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the garden of my life<br />
I'm done with envy, done with strife.<br />
I cultivate my natural joys<br />
Far from this culture's fearful noise.
</p>
<p>
Congress hall and marketplace,<br />
Fame's small change and honor's race,<br />
Academe's cold, haughty tower<br />
Have no meaning, hold no power.
</p>
<p>
Letting go of shoulds and oughts,<br />
I concentrate on greener thoughts<br />
And find as I fulfill my soul<br />
That things spin calmly in control &mdash;
</p>
<p>
That though events conspire still,<br />
They tend to bend toward my will.<br />
No greater cause achieves the measure<br />
Than that of my own reasoned pleasure.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul, it's been a true pleasure exploring Epicurus and Lucretius with you, and I hope you've enjoyed it as much as I have!</p>
<p>Your friend,</p>
<p>Schuyler</p>

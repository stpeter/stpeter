<h1>Epicurus on Happiness</h1>

<h2>I. Knowing How to Live</h2>

<p>Most people think of philosophy as a boring, academic activity that is irrelevant to the pursuit of happiness. But that is not what philosophy meant to the ancient Greeks, who invented philosophy itself.</p>

<p>For the ancient Greeks, the "philo-" prefix meant to love a thing or activity, to take great interest in it, to practice it intensively, to find your highest pleasure in it. Thus the ancient Greeks had a dozens of terms like φιλόγαιος (earth-lover), φιλογύνης (interested in women), φιλόθηρος (enjoying the hunt), φίλοινος (wine-lover), φιλότεχνος (loving or practicing an art), even φιλόφιλος (taking great pleasure in your friends). So a φιλόσοφος was someone who loved, took pleasure in, was intensely interested in, was fascinated by, or intensively practiced σοφία.</p>

<p>But what was this σοφία? To be σοφός was to be skillful, clever, cunning, crafty, prudent, shrewd, wise in the sense of streetwise, but also well-taught, knowledgeable, learned, profound, subtle, abstruse. You could have σοφία — know-how — in practical activities like carpentry or shipbuilding or the playing of the lyre. You could also have it in language and discourse, like the Sophists, who would teach you (for a fee) the tricks of the rhetorical trade so that you could be skillful and successful in the public life of the city-state.</p>

<p>Yet merely to be fond of speaking (φιλόλογος) was not the same as being fond of wisdom (φιλόσοφος), because φιλοσοφία was a way of living — especially a particular rule of life associated with a school (really a community of like-minded and similarly-instructed fellow seekers-after-wisdom) such as the Platonists or Stoics or Epicureans. To be a philosopher meant to live a philosophical life: not a life of theoretical hair-splitting, but a life of practical wisdom, active reason and reasoned action, deep reflection, true consciousness, vibrant awareness, moral ambition, never-ending spiritual practice, continual striving after self-improvement, the exercise of all your faculties, skillfulness in the great task of living a fully human life. To be a philosopher meant really and truly knowing how to live.</p>

<p>Yet that vision is not only ancient. As Thoreau said not so very long ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not just theoretically, but practically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Epicurus, too, felt that philosophy was both the love of wisdom and the practice of knowing how to live. He believed that "passion for true philosophy destroys every disturbing and troublesome desire" (<a href='fragments.html#a457'>Fragment 457</a>), that "the noble soul is devoted most of all to wisdom" (<a href='vatican-sayings.html#a78'>Vatican Saying 78</a>), that "in the pursuit of wisdom knowledge is accompanied by delight" (<a href='vatican-sayings.html#a27'>Vatican Saying 27</a>).</p>

<h2>II. Healing the Soul</h2>

<p>Yet Epicurus went farther, for he held that philosophy is the art of healing the soul:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A philosopher's words are empty if they do not heal the suffering of mankind. For just as medicine is useless if it does not remove sickness from the body, so philosophy is useless if it does not remove suffering from the soul. (<a href='fragments.html#a221'>Fragment 221</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not pretend to love and practice wisdom, but love and practice wisdom in reality; for we need not the appearance of health but true health. (<a href='vatican-sayings.html#a54'>Vatican Saying 54</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Epicurus took the analogy of philosophy as medicine quite seriously. What, then, are the diseases of the soul, and their opposite states of health?</p>

In reading the surviving texts of Epicurus, I count six:</p>

<h3>II.1. Pain vs. Joy</h3>

<p>The first of these diseases is pain, whether physical or mental or emotional. Its opposite state of health is joy, pleasure, delight.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The limit of enjoyment is the removal of all pains. Wherever and for however long pleasure is present, there is neither bodily pain nor mental distress. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a3'>Principal Doctrine 3</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our every action is done so that we will not be in pain or fear. (<a href='letter.html#p128'>Letter Section 128</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is not possible to live joyously without also living wisely and beautifully and rightly, nor to live wisely and beautifully and rightly without living joyously; and whoever lacks this cannot live joyously. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a5'>Principal Doctrine 5</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are born only once and cannot be born twice, and must forever live no more. You don't control tomorrow, yet you postpone joy. Life is ruined by putting things off, and each of us dies without truly resting. (<a href='vatican-sayings.html#a14'>Vatican Saying 14</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pain does not last continuously in the flesh; instead, the sharpest pain lasts the shortest time, a pain that exceeds bodily pleasure lasts only a few days, and diseases that last a long time involve delights that exceed their pains. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a4'>Principal Doctrine 4</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The flesh assumes that the limits of joy are infinite, and that infinite joy can be produced only through infinite time. But the mind, reasoning out the goal and limits of the flesh and dissolving fears about eternity, produces a complete way of life and therefore has no need of infinite time; yet the mind does not flee from joy, nor when events cause it to exit from life does it look back as if it has missed any aspect of the best life. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a20'>Principal Doctrine 20</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>One who needs tomorrow least, most gladly greets the coming day. (<a href='fragments.html#a490'>Fragment 490</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>II.2. Fear vs. Confidence</h3>

<p>Epicurus saw that too many people live in fear, when they could have a natural confidence in their ability to live.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Insofar as you forget nature, you will find yourself in trouble and create for yourself endless fears and desires. (<a href='fragments.html#a203'>Fragment 203</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As soon as the pain produced by the lack of something is removed, pleasure in the flesh is not increased but only embellished. Yet the limit of enjoyment in the mind is produced by reasoning about these very things and similar things, which once provoked the greatest fears in the mind. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a18'>Principal Doctrine 18</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I summon you to sustained enjoyment and not to empty and trifling virtues, which destroy your confidence in the fruits of what you have. (<a href='fragments.html#a116'>Fragment 116</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>To those who are able to reason it out, the highest and surest joy is found in the stable health of the body and a firm confidence in keeping it. (<a href='fragments.html#a68'>Fragment 68</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>II.3. Confusion vs. Clarity</h3>

<p>confusion/ignorance/numbness vs. clarity/awareness/understanding</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One who acts aright is utterly steady and serene, whereas one who goes astray is full of trouble and confusion. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a17'>Principal Doctrine 17</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You must reflect on the fundamental goal and everything that is clear, to which opinions are referred; if you do not, all will be full of trouble and confusion. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a22'>Principal Doctrine 22</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>For most people, to be quiet is to be numb and to be active is to be frenzied. (<a href='vatican-sayings.html#a11'>Vatican Saying 11</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is not the young man who is most happy, but the old man who has lived beautifully; for despite being at his very peak the young man stumbles around as if he were of many minds, while the old man has settled into old age as if in a harbor, secure in his gratitude for the good things he was once unsure of. (<a href='vatican-sayings.html#a17'>Vatican Saying 17</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>II.4. Turmoil vs. Serenity</h3>

<p>turmoil/frenzy vs. serenity</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So when we say that pleasure is the goal, we do not mean the pleasures of decadent people or the enjoyment of sleep, as is believed by those who are ignorant or who don't understand us or who are ill-disposed to us, but to be free from bodily pain and mental disturbance. For a pleasant life is produced not by drinking and endless parties and enjoying boys and women and consuming fish and other delicacies of an extravagant table, but by sober reasoning, searching out the cause of everything we accept or reject, and driving out opinions that cause the greatest trouble in the soul. (<a href='letter.html#p131'>Letter Section 131</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>No pleasure is bad in itself; but the means of paying for some pleasures bring with them disturbances many times greater than the pleasures themselves. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a8'>Principal Doctrine 8</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>One who acts aright is utterly steady and serene, whereas one who goes astray is full of trouble and confusion. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a17'>Principal Doctrine 17</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is better for you to lie serene upon a bed of straw than to be full of troubles on a golden chair at an overflowing table. (<a href='fragments.html#a207'>Fragment 207</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Passion for true philosophy destroys every disturbing and troublesome desire. (<a href='fragments.html#a457'>Fragment 457</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>For most people, to be quiet is to be numb and to be active is to be frenzied. (<a href='vatican-sayings.html#a11'>Vatican Saying 11</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He who is as peace within himself also causes no trouble for others. (<a href='vatican-sayings.html#a79'>Vatican Saying 79</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A young man's share in deliverance comes from watching over the prime of his life and warding off what will ruin everything through frenzied desires. (<a href='vatican-sayings.html#a80'>Vatican Saying 80</a>])</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>II.5. Dependence vs. Self-Reliance</h3>

<p>dependence vs. self-reliance</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We hold that self-reliance is a great good — not so that we will always have only a few things but so that if we do not have much we will rejoice in the few things we have, firmly persuaded that those who need luxury the least enjoy it the most, and that everything natural is easily obtained whereas everything groundless is hard to get. (<a href='letter.html#p130'>Letter Section 130</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We value self-reliance not so that we will live simply and cheaply in all things, but so that we will not be consumed by them. (<a href='fragments.html#a135a'>Fragment 135a</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He who follows nature and not groundless opinions is completely self-reliant. With regard to what is enough by nature, everything he owns is a source of wealth; whereas with regard to unlimited desires even the greatest wealth is poverty. (<a href='fragments.html#a202'>Fragment 202</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Self-reliance is the greatest wealth of all. (<a href='fragments.html#a476'>Fragment 476</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the sage contends with necessity, he is skilled at giving rather than taking — such a treasury of self-reliance has he found. (<a href='vatican-sayings.html#a44'>Vatican Saying 44</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The study of what is natural produces not braggarts nor windbags nor those who show off the culture that most people fight about, but those who are fearless and self-reliant and who value their own good qualities rather than the good things that have come to them from external circumstances. (<a href='vatican-sayings.html#a45'>Vatican Saying 45</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The greatest fruit of self-reliance is freedom. (<a href='vatican-sayings.html#a77'>Vatican Saying 77</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>II.6. Dissolution vs. Harmony</h3>

<p>dissolution / decadence vs. harmony / integrity</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So when we say that pleasure is the goal, we do not mean the pleasures of decadent people or the enjoyment of sleep, as is believed by those who are ignorant or who don't understand us or who are ill-disposed to us, but to be free from bodily pain and mental disturbance. For a pleasant life is produced not by drinking and endless parties and enjoying boys and women and consuming fish and other delicacies of an extravagant table, but by sober reasoning, searching out the cause of everything we accept or reject, and driving out opinions that cause the greatest trouble in the soul. (<a href='letter.html#p131'>Letter Section 131</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the things that produced the delights of those who are decadent washed away the mind's fears about astronomical phenomena and death and suffering, and furthermore if they taught us the limits of our pains and desires, then we would have no complaints against them, since they would be filled with every joy and would contain not a single pain or distress (and that's what is bad). (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a10'>Principal Doctrine 10</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If at all critical times you do not connect each of your actions to the natural goal of life, but instead turn too soon to some other kind of goal in thinking whether to avoid or pursue something, then your thoughts and your actions will not be in harmony. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a25'>Principal Doctrine 25</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nature is weak before what is bad, not before what is good; for it is kept whole by pleasures and broken down by pains. (<a href='vatican-sayings.html#a37'>Vatican Saying 37</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>III. The Remedies</h2>

<p>What causes the diseases of the soul and what are the remedies?</p>

<h3>III.1. Facing Death Without Fear</h3>

  <p>believing that death is something to be feared vs. knowing that death is nothing to us</p>
  
<blockquote>
  <p>Train yourself to hold that death is nothing to us, because good and evil consist in sensation, and death is the removal of sensation. A correct understanding that death is nothing to us makes the mortality of life enjoyable — not because it gives one an unbounded span of time, but because it removes the desire for immortality. There is nothing terrifying in life to one who truly understands that there is nothing terrifying in the absence of life. (<a href='letter.html#p124'>Letter Section 124</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
  
<blockquote>
  <p>Only a fool says that he fears death because it causes pain ahead of time, not because it will cause pain when it comes. For something that causes no trouble when present causes only a groundless pain when merely expected. So death, the most terrifying of evils, is nothing to us, because as long as we exist death is not present, whereas when death is present we do not exist. It is nothing to those who live (since to them it does not exist) and it is nothing to those who have died (since they no longer exist). (<a href='letter.html#p125'>Letter Section 125</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
    
<blockquote>
  <p>Most people shrink from death as the greatest of evils, or else extol it as a release from the evils of life. Yet the wise man does not dishonor life (since he is not set against it) and he is not afraid to stop living (since he does not consider that to be a bad thing). Just as he does not choose the greatest amount of food but the most pleasing food, so he savors not the longest time but the span of time that brings the greatest joy. It is simpleminded to advise a young person to live well and an old person to die well, not only because life is so welcome but also because it is through the very same practices that one both lives well and dies well. (<a href='letter.html#p126'>Letter Section 126</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
      
<blockquote>
  <p>Death is nothing to us; for what has disintegrated lacks awareness, and what lacks awareness is nothing to us. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a2'>Principal Doctrine 2</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>III.2. Understanding that You Control Your Life</h3>

  <p>believing that your life is controlled by outside forces (e.g. the gods) vs. knowing that the gods are not involved in human life </p>
  
<blockquote>
  <p>The things that most people say about the gods are based on false assumptions, not a firm grasp of the facts, because they say that the greatest goods and the greatest harms come from the gods. (<a href='letter.html#p123'>Letter Section 123</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
    
<blockquote>
  <p>In short, whom do you consider better than someone who holds pious opinions about the gods, who is always fearless in the face of death, who has reasoned out the natural goal of life, and who has understood that the limit of good things is easy to fulfill and easy to achieve, whereas the limit of bad things is either short-lived or cause little pain? Someone who laughs at destiny, which is asserted by some to be the master of all things? For he holds that we are responsible for what we achieve, even though some things happen by necessity, some by chance, and some by our own power, because although necessity is not accountable he sees that chance is unstable whereas the things that are within our power have no other master, so that naturally praise and blame are inseparably connected to them. Indeed he sees that it would be better even to cleave to the myths about the gods (since that leaves some hope of prevailing upon them through worship) than to be subject to the destiny of the scientists (since that way lies an inexorable necessity). And such a man holds that Fate is not a god (as most people believe) because a god does nothing disorderly, and he holds that Fate is not an uncertain cause because nothing good or bad with respect to a completely happy life is given to men by chance, although it does provide the beginnings of both great goods and great evils. And he considers it better to be rationally unfortunate than irrationally fortunate, since it is better for a beautiful choice to have the wrong results than for an ugly choice to have the right results just by chance. (<a href='letter.html#p133'>Letter Section 133</a> ff.)</p>
</blockquote>
    
<blockquote>
  <p>That which is blissful and immortal has no troubles itself, nor does it cause trouble for others, so that it is not affected by anger or gratitude (for all such things come about through weakness). (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a1'>Principal Doctrine 1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
        
<blockquote>
  <p>If the things that produced the delights of those who are decadent washed away the mind's fears about astronomical phenomena and death and suffering, and furthermore if they taught us the limits of our pains and desires, then we would have no complaints against them, since they would be filled with every joy and would contain not a single pain or distress (and that's what is bad). (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a10'>Principal Doctrine 10</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
          
<blockquote>
  <p>If our suspicions about astronomical phenomena and about death were nothing to us and troubled us not at all, and if this were also the case regarding our ignorance about the limits of our pains and desires, then we would have no need for studying what is natural. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a11'>Principal Doctrine 11</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
            
<blockquote>
  <p>   It is impossible for someone who is completely ignorant about nature to wash away his fears about the most important matters if he retains some suspicions about the myths. So it is impossible to experience undiluted enjoyment without studying what is natural. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a12'>Principal Doctrine 12</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
              
<blockquote>
  <p>It is useless to be safe from other people while retaining suspicions about what is above and below the earth and in general about the infinite unknown. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a13'>Principal Doctrine 13</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>III.3. Understanding Human Nature</h3>

  <p>filling your head with groundless opinions vs. understanding human nature </p>
  
<blockquote>
  <p>Natural wealth is both limited and easy to acquire, but the riches incited by groundless opinion have no end. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a15'>Principal Doctrine 15</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
    
<blockquote>
  <p>If at all critical times you do not connect each of your actions to the natural goal of life, but instead turn too soon to some other kind of goal in thinking whether to avoid or pursue something, then your thoughts and your actions will not be in harmony. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a25'>Principal Doctrine 25</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
      
<blockquote>
  <p>Among desires, some are natural and necessary, some are natural and unnecessary, and some are unnatural and unnecessary (arising instead from groundless opinion). (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a29'>Principal Doctrine 29</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
        
<blockquote>
  <p>Among natural desires, those that do not bring pain when unfulfilled and that require intense exertion arise from groundless opinion; and such desires fail to be stamped out not by nature but because of the groundless opinions of humankind. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a30'>Principal Doctrine 30</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
          
<blockquote>
  <p>Don't think it unnatural that when the body cries out, the soul cries also. The body says don't be hungry, don't be thirsty, don't be cold. It is difficult for the soul to prevent these cries, and dangerous for it to ignore the commands of nature because of attachment to its usual independence. (<a href='fragments.html#a200'>Fragment 200</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
            
<blockquote>
  <p>He who follows nature and not groundless opinions is completely self-reliant. With regard to what is enough by nature, everything he owns is a source of wealth; whereas with regard to unlimited desires even the greatest wealth is poverty. (<a href='fragments.html#a202'>Fragment 202</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
              
<blockquote>
  <p>Insofar as you forget nature, you will find yourself in trouble and create for yourself endless fears and desires. (<a href='fragments.html#a203'>Fragment 203</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
                
<blockquote>
  <p>The beginning and root of all good is the pleasure of the stomach; even wisdom and refinements have reference to this. (<a href='fragments.html#a409'>Fragment 409</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
                  
<blockquote>
  <p>We need pleasure when in pain because of its absence; but when we are not experiencing such pain, and are perceiving stably, then there is no need for pleasure. For it is not the needs of nature which, from without, create harm, but desire driven by groundless opinions. (<a href='fragments.html#a422'>Fragment 422</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
                    
<blockquote>
  <p>What brings unsurpassed joy is the removal of a great evil; and this is the nature of the good, if you apply your mind rightly and then stand firm and do not stroll about chattering emptily. (<a href='fragments.html#a423'>Fragment 423</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
                      
<blockquote>
  <p>We must not blame the body for the greatest evils nor attribute our troubles to mere circumstance. Instead we seek their cause within the soul: for by giving up every groundless and fleeting desire we give birth to a confidence perfect in itself. (<a href='fragments.html#a445'>Fragment 445</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
                        
<blockquote>
  <p>Unhappiness is caused by fears, or by endless and empty desires; but he who is able to rein these in creates for himself a blissful understanding. (<a href='fragments.html#a485'>Fragment 485</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
                          
<blockquote>
  <p>Pain does not consist in being deprived of things, but rather in bearing the avoidable distress caused by groundless opinion. (<a href='fragments.html#a486'>Fragment 486</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
                            
<blockquote>
  <p>Nature teaches us to think nothing of what fortune brings, to understand that when prospering we are unfortunate and when not prospering we are fortunate, to receive undisturbed the good things that fortune brings and to stand ready for its seeming evils. For what is good or evil to most people is fleeting, and wisdom has nothing in common with fortune. (<a href='fragments.html#a489'>Fragment 489</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
                              
<blockquote>
  <p>Nature must be persuaded, not forced. And we will persuade nature by fulfilling the necessary desires, and the natural desires too if they cause no harm, but pointedly rejecting the harmful desires. (<a href='vatican-sayings.html#a21'>Vatican Saying 21</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

  <p>The stomach is not insatiable, as most people say; instead the opinion that the stomach needs unlimited filling is false. (<a href='vatican-sayings.html#a59'>Vatican Saying 59</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>III.4. Living in Accordance With What is Natural</h3>

  <p>giving in to desires that are unnatural and unnecessary vs. desiring only what is natural and necessary </p>
  
<blockquote>
  <p>Keep in mind that some desires are natural whereas others are groundless; that among the natural desires some are natural and necessary whereas others are merely natural; and that among the necessary desires some are necessary for happiness, some for physical health, and some for life itself. The steady contemplation of these facts enables you to understand everything that you accept or reject in terms of the health of the body and the serenity of the soul, since that is the goal of a completely happy life. Our every action is done so that we will not be in pain or fear. As soon as we achieve this, the soul is released from every storm, since an animal has no other need and must seek nothing else to complete the goodness of body and soul. Thus we need pleasure only when we are in pain caused by its absence; but when we are not in pain then we have no need of pleasure. (<a href='letter.html#p127'>Letter Section 127</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
    
<blockquote>
  <p>This is why we say that pleasure is the beginning and the end of a completely happy life. For we recognize it as the primary and innate good, we honor it in everything we accept or reject, and we achieve it if we judge every good thing by the standard of how it affects us. And because this is the primary and inborn good, we do not choose every pleasure. Instead, we pass up many pleasures when we will gain more of what we need from doing so. And we consider many pains to be better than pleasures, if we experience a greater pleasure for a long time from having endured those pains. So every pleasure is a good thing because its nature is favorable to us, yet not every pleasure is to be chosen — just as every pain is a bad thing, yet not every pain is always to be shunned. It is proper to make all these decisions through measuring things side by side and looking at both the advantages and disadvantages, for sometimes we treat a good thing as bad and a bad thing as good. (<a href='letter.html#p128'>Letter Section 128</a>)</p>

  <p>Natural wealth is both limited and easy to acquire, but the riches incited by groundless opinion have no end. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a15'>Principal Doctrine 15</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The desires that do not bring pain when they go unfulfilled are not necessary; indeed they are easy to reject when they are hard to achieve or when they seem to produce harm. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a26'>Principal Doctrine 26</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
          
<blockquote>

  <p>seeking the esteem of others vs. basing your esteem on your own accomplishments </p>
  
<blockquote>
  <p>Some people want to be well esteemed and widely admired, believing that in this way they will be safe from others; if the life of such people is secure then they have gained its natural benefit, but if not then they have not gained what they sought from the beginning in accordance with what is naturally appropriate.

<h3>III.11. Being Uncompetitive</h3>

  <p>envying others vs. being happy with what you have and what you are </p>

</blockquote>
    
<blockquote>
  <p>The person who has put together the best means for confidence about external threats is one who has become familiar with what is possible and at least not unfamiliar with what is not possible, but who has not mixed with things where even this could not be managed and who has driven away anything that is not advantageous.

</blockquote>
                
<blockquote>
  <p>A free person is unable to acquire great wealth, because that is not easily achieved without enslavement to the masses or to the powers that be. Instead, he already has everything he needs, and in abundance. But if by chance he should have great wealth, he could easily share that with his fellows to win their goodwill.

<h3>III.13. Being Unswayed by the Winds of Fortune</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nature teaches us to think nothing of what fortune brings, to understand that when prospering we are unfortunate and when not prospering we are fortunate, to receive undisturbed the good things that fortune brings and to stand ready for its seeming evils. For what is good or evil to most people is fleeting, and wisdom has nothing in common with fortune. (<a href='fragments.html#a489'>Fragment 489</a>)</p>

<h3>III.14. Directing Your Life by Reason</h3>
  <p>being driven by chance events vs. directing your life by reason </p>

</blockquote>
    
<blockquote>
  <p>As soon as the pain produced by the lack of something is removed, pleasure in the flesh is not increased but only embellished.

(<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a18'>Principal Doctrine 18</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Infinite time and finite time contain the same amount of joy, if its limits are measured out through reasoning. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a19'>Principal Doctrine 19</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
        
<blockquote>
  <p>The flesh assumes that the limits of joy are infinite, and that infinite joy can be produced only through infinite time. But the mind, reasoning out the goal and limits of the flesh and dissolving fears about eternity, produces a complete way of life and therefore has no need of infinite time; yet the mind does not flee from joy, nor when events cause it to exit from life does it look back as if it has missed any aspect of the best life. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a20'>Principal Doctrine 20</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
          
<blockquote>
  <p>You must reflect on the fundamental goal and everything that is clear, to which opinions are referred; if you do not, all will be full of trouble and confusion. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a22'>Principal Doctrine 22</a>)</p>

  <p>No one who sees what is bad chooses it willingly; instead he is lured into seeing it as good compared to what is even worse, and thus he is trapped. (<a href='vatican-sayings.html#a16'>Vatican Saying 16</a>)</p>

<h3>III.15. Treating Others With Justice</h3>

  <p>harming others or being harmed by them (causing or experiencing injustice) vs. treating others with justice and being safe and secure </p>
  
<blockquote>
  <p>Although some measure of safety from others comes from the power to fight them off and from abundant wealth, the purest security comes from solitude and breaking away from the herd. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a14'>Principal Doctrine 14</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Natural justice is a covenant for mutual benefit, to not harm one another or be harmed. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a31'>Principal Doctrine 31</a>)</p>

  <p>Justice does not exist in itself; instead, it is always a compact to not harm one another or be harmed, which is agreed upon by those who gather together at some time and place. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a33'>Principal Doctrine 33</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In general, justice is the same for all: what is mutually advantageous among companions. But with respect to the particulars of a place or other causes, it does not follow that the same thing is just for all. (<a href='principal-doctrines.html#a36'>Principal Doctrine 36</a>)</p>

<h3>III.17. Being at Peace With Yourself</h3>

<p>doing one thing but thinking another vs. keeping your thoughts and actions in harmony </p>
  
<blockquote>
  <p>If at all critical times you do not connect each of your actions to the natural goal of life, but instead turn too soon to some other kind of goal in thinking whether to avoid or pursue something, then your thoughts and your actions will not be in harmony.

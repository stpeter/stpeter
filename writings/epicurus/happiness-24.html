<p>Dear Schuyler,</p>
<p>Thanks for sending that poem &mdash; it does a good job of capturing the Epicurean sense of life in contemporary language (and it's certainly a quicker read than Lucretius!).</p>
<p>Speaking of brief summaries, I've discovered an ancient recipe for happiness according to Epicurus, called the "tetrapharmakos" or four-fold cure:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
Don't fear god.<br/>
Don't worry about death.<br/>
What's good is easy to get.<br/>
What's bad is easy to bear.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't get much simpler than that, does it? Although we have picked up some more particular advice along the way, the four-fold cure cuts to the essence and is quite memorable (as Epicurus noted in the Vatican Sayings, "short discourses and long discourses both achieve the same thing").</p>
<p>I know I've certainly enjoyed our discourse about Epicurus, too! Let's do it again sometime. ;-)</p>
<p>Your friend,</p>
<p>Paul</p>
<hr/>
<p>THE END</p>

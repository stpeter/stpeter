<p>I'm wondering if it's time to bring back citizen militias. Not the National Guard, but true, grassroots, localized, citizen-led fighting forces all across the nation. And every member of these militias would have not only training in how to use a gun, but the absolute right to carry one wherever and however they please, including concealed weapons on airplanes and in other "gun-free" zones. Now that will put some fear in would-be terrorists.</p>

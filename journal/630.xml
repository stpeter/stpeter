    <p>It <a href="http://www.dijest.com/aka/2003/08/22.html">seems</a> (with a nod to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rene_Descartes">Ren&amp;#xE9; Descartes</a>) that <a href="109.html">I coined</a> the phrase "blogito ergo sum" back on October 8th, 2001 (and Google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=blogito+ergo+sum">agrees</a>). Now folks are <a href="http://www.electees.com/qblogs.html">offering customized T-shirts</a> with that phrase -- perhaps they'll be the hot Christmas gift for bloggers worldwide. And it's as true today as it ever was: I blog therefore I am. :-)</p>

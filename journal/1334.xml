<p>I finally got myself a <a href="360.html">Gadsden Flag</a> of the kind that graces the sidebar on my blog.</p>
<p><img src='/images/gadsden.jpg'/></p>
<p>When I first unfurled it, my inner editor was horrified to learn that it contains a typo: "DONT" instead of "DON'T". A quick call to <a href="http://www.flagline.com/">Flagline.com</a> confirmed that the folks at <a href="http://annin.com/">Annin</a> (the producer of the flag) have done their research and consider this to be historically accurate, proving that the original American patriots weren't about to let a little old apostrophe get in the way of a revolution! (You'll also notice that some Gadsden flags don't contain the green grass below the snake, and the snake lacks coloration &mdash; more historical inaccuracies, it seems.)</p>

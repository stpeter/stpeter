<p>One of my three faithful readers pointed me to a <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/interrogatory/interrogatory090402.asp">provocative interview</a> with Tracy Lee Simmons, author of <cite>Climbing Parnassus: A New Apologia for Greek and Latin</cite>. Well, it's provocative to me, anyway, since I majored in classics (along with philosophy). I certainly think that my humanist education has stood me in good stead, though sometimes I wish I'd at least taken a few programming classes.</p>

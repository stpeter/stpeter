    <p>Adam Bosworth's <a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000028.html">latest entry</a> is a variation on a theme <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/road.html">originated</a> (as far as I know) by Paul Graham back in 2001: it's better to offer an application over the Net than to ship an old-style software bundle. Both essays are well worth (re-)reading. Bosworth's thoughts are also connected in my mind with what I like to call <a href="519.html">the need for speed</a> and <a href="595.html">the real-time Internet</a>, because <a href="593.html">life is getting faster</a> and software needs to keep up. Evolution in action, indeed!</p>

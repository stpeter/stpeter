    <p>I don't like it when bloggers ask for money -- even when they're <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/12/donate_to_margi.html">bloggers I like</a>. If you can't afford to blog, don't do so. There's something pitiful about the self-perception of those who think of themselves as <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/wordoftheday/2003/05/14/eleemosynary">charity cases</a> who must beg in order to blog. Better, methinks, for one's blogging activity to "emerge from what is healthy, from overflowing well being, from living existence to the full" (Nietzsche, <a href="http://www.mala.bc.ca/~johnstoi/Nietzsche/tragedy_all.htm">The Birth of Tragedy</a>, <cite>Attempt at a Self-Criticism</cite>).</p>

<p>I've finished a draft of my final <a href="http://monadnock.net/epicurus/">Epicurus</a> translation: his <a href="http://monadnock.net/epicurus/letter.html">Letter to Menoeceus</a>. Now that I've rendered just about all of his ethical writings from Greek into English, I plan to weave them together with commentary into a short book entitled <cite>Epicurus on Happiness</cite>. Stay tuned for details.</p>

<p>I wrote some more "words of the week" on my whiteboard at work this week (wow, I wonder how many "w" words I can fit in a sentence!). This week's words were animadversion, otiose, prolix, preternatural, and pusillanimous. I was tempted to add susurrus but I think I'll save that for next time. :)</p>

<p>Yesterday I did something I never expected to do: I registered Republican.</p>
<p>Why, you might ask, did a fiercely independent person like me do such a thing? So that I can vote for <a href="http://www.ronpaul2008.com/">Ron Paul</a> in the primary election. I don't agree with all the planks in Dr. Paul's platform, but voting for his candidacy is the best chance I've got to stick it to big-government Republicans. And believe me, after George "I'm-above-the-Constitution-and-don't-you-forget-it" Bush, big-government Republicans need to be resoundingly repudiated.</p>

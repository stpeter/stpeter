<p>Wow, today was my first day of work at <a href="http://www.jabber.com/">Jabber.com</a>. This is really a dream job for me, since I get to work on Jabber all day. I've been helping out with the Jabber project on the open-source side of things (i.e., <a href="https://www.jabber.org/">jabber.org</a>) since last December, so it's awesome to be working on it full-time. Special thanks to Harry Grout for letting me move upstairs!</p>

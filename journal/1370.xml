<p>For some sobering thoughts on what's in store with regard to the economy and society, I highly recommend the following essays that came across my radar today:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.investorsinsight.com/blogs/john_mauldins_outside_the_box/archive/2009/07/13/debt-and-deflation.aspx">Debt and Deflation</a> by Van R. Hoisington and Lacy H. Hunt</li>
<li><a href="http://www.investorsinsight.com/blogs/thoughts_from_the_frontline/archive/2009/07/10/buddy-can-you-spare-5-trillion.aspx">Buddy, Can You Spare $5 Trillion?</a> by John Mauldin</li>
<li><a href="http://whiskeyandgunpowder.com/a-20-year-bull-market/print/">A 20-Year Bear Market?</a> by David Galland</li>
</ul>
<p>Grokking all three in fullness will drive any notions of "green shoots" right out of your head.</p>
<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124753066246235811.html">The Economy Is Even Worse Than You Think</a> (WSJ)</p>

    <p>Embedded in <a href="http://www.financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/000169.html">this screed</a> on <a href="http://www.antiphishing.org/">phishing</a>, I found this little gem:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>As it happens my take on the whole RIAA thing is to stop buying CDs and learn the guitar.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>My philosophy exactly, which is why I <a href="/music/">make my own damn music</a> (as yet unrecorded, though...).</p>
    <p>Predictably, my take on phishing is, yet again, abandon email and use an IM system in which people can't spoof 'from' addresses. <a href="https://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a>, anyone?</p>

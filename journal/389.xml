<p>Seeing <a href="http://www.pipetree.com/qmacro">DJ</a> again has been good for the soul. Haven't gotten much time to chat with him yet, though. One of his <a href="http://www.pipetree.com/qmacro/2003/07/06#thinking">recent blog entries</a> provides some valuable perspective about thinking vs. doing in the technology space and elsewhere. Yes, whatever did happen to exploring ideas for their own sake? His questions speak directly to my philosophical inclinations. Plus I love his phrase "ontological rivets"!</p>

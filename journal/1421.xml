<p>I'm happy to announce that the RFC Editor has just published <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6120.txt">RFC 6120</a>, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6121.txt">RFC 6121</a>, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6122.txt">RFC 6122</a>, and, for good measure, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6125.txt">RFC 6125</a>.  These specifications define the fundamentals of XMPP and are a big improvement over the old RFCs that we finished in 2004. Thanks to everyone who helped me get these documents across the finish line!</p>

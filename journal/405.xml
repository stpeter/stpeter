<p>Book Magazine has published a list of <a href="http://www.bookmagazine.com/issue29/best.html">classic bestsellers</a>. One can quibble with their criteria (I'd hardly classify <cite>Clan of the Cave Bear</cite> as a "classic"), but the list makes for interesting reading nonetheless. It's amazing that books like <cite>The Catcher in the Rye</cite> and <cite>To Kill a Mockingbird</cite> continue to sell around 500,000 copies a year (someone's heirs are raking it in). My old favorites <cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite> and <cite>The Fountainhead</cite> come in at #19 and #35 (in 2002 they sold 130,000 and 81,000 copies respectively). No wonder the Ayn Rand Industry keeps growing. (Thanks to <a href="http://eliot.landrum.cx/">Eliot Landrum</a> for the link.)</p>

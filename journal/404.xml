<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.clairewolfe.com/blog.html">Claire</a> comes <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig4/ellis1.html">this story</a> about Davy Crockett. After his pioneer days and before his Alamo days, Crockett was what Robert Heinlein would call a congresscritter. Amazingly, he even learned to respect the Constitution in that job, thanks to a farmer named Horatio Bunce. Well worth reading, or re-reading as the case may be.</p>

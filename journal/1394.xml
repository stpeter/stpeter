<p>At my favorite library the other day I picked up Julie Rose's recent translation of <cite>Les Mis&#xE9;rables</cite>.

Somewhere in <cite>Daybreak</cite> or <cite>Human, All Too Human</cite> or <cite>La Gaya Scienza</cite>, Nietzsche talks about the propensity of certain personality types to dive into the depths rather than to float widely on the surface of things, and I think I fall into the deep-diving category.

<p>Zone-H has a <a href="http://www.zone-h.org/en/news/read/id=3287/">fascinating interview</a> with Professor Samuel D. Forrester, one of the foremost immunologists in the world. His conclusion is that virus writers perform a valuable service to the Internet community by continually strengthening the Internet's "antibodies". As Nietzsche once said: "what doesn't kill me, makes me stronger". (Thanks once again to <a href="https://blog.dizzyd.com/">DizzyD</a> for the news tip.)</p>

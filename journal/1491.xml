<p>I've had yet another document published in the <a href='http://www.rfc-editor.org/'>RFC series</a>: a very short specification (<a href='http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6993.txt'>RFC 6993</a>) that defines a way for a communication endpoint to advertise its XMPP address over SIP. This is a bit of supporting structure for the work I've been doing with Emil Ivov and Encrico Marocco on dual-stack SIP+XMPP clients, in the form of <a href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ivov-xmpp-cusax/'>draft-ivov-xmpp-cusax</a> (which itself is close to final review at the IETF).</p>

<p>Two things that computer geeks do a lot of are sitting and typing. Unfortunately, as I know from personal experience, that can lead to both back trouble and wrist trouble. The best books I've found on these topics are <a href="http://www.take-care.com/knee/helpbook.html">The Back Pain Help Book</a> and <a href="http://isbn.nu/1558535918">End Your Carpal Tunnel Pain Without Surgery</a>. They're probably available at a public library near you, so if you sit a lot and type a lot, do yourself a favor and check 'em out.</p>

    <p>It seems I forgot to mention that I'm giving an invited talk this Friday at the <a href="http://fv2010.colostate.edu/">FutureVision 2010</a> conference being held on the campus of <a href="http://www.colostate.edu/">Colorado State University</a>. Check out the <a href="http://fv2010.colostate.edu/program.pdf">program</a> for details. The talk is not about Jabber or any specific technology, more about technology trends caused by ubiquitous computing and always-on connectivity. But you can be sure that presence, identity, real-time communications, security, and intellectual property will be part of the mix... :-)</p>

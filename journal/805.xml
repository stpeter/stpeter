    <p>It seems I forgot to mention that I'm giving an invited talk this Friday at the FutureVision 2010 conference being held on the campus of <a href="https://www.colostate.edu/">Colorado State University</a>. The talk is not about Jabber or any specific technology, more about technology trends caused by ubiquitous computing and always-on connectivity. But you can be sure that presence, identity, real-time communications, security, and intellectual property will be part of the mix... :-)</p>

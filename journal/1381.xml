<p>An instant classic from <a href="http://www.samizdata.net/blog/archives/2009/10/ftc_takes_on_th.html">Perry de Havilland</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The notion that the US blogosphere is going to allow the US state to require it to register certain content is something that has me wondering if some cunning conspiracy was not at work by a shadowy cabal of Good Guys (who inexplicably did not let me in on the plan) luring the enemy into a sort of virtual Teutoburger Wald by playing to hubris and Imperial overreach. These people do not really even understand what the internet is I suspect.</p>
<p>I can not tell you how delighted I am. When a body like the Federal Trade Commission commits itself to an unwinnable fight against an almost literally endless enemy with the ability to vanish and reappear at will, it is a clear sign that terminal stupidity has set in, which is really rather good news.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I note that the FTC has admitted that enforcement would be selective, which means "we'll go after you if we don't like you", so I tend to think the FTC might just get away with the envisioned monstrosity&hellip;</p>

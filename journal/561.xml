    <p>Chatting in the jdev room yesterday, <a href="http://www.talios.com/">talios</a> said he was mentioned in an <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/storydisplay.cfm?thesection=technology&amp;thesubsection=&amp;storyID=3579823">NZ Herald article</a> on weblogs. Following some links, I came across <a href="http://mjr.towers.org.uk/blog/2004-5.html#cc2nonfree@2004-5.mjr.dsl.pipex.com">this post</a> on the undue restrictions in <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licenses (it seems that the <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> community has <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/04/msg00031.html">concluded</a> that the CC licenses violate the <a href="https://people.debian.org/~bap/dfsg-faq.html">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a>). While thinking hard about content licensing last year, I flirted with the CC licenses but just never could get comfortable with them, which is partly why I ended up putting all of my writings and music in the public domain.

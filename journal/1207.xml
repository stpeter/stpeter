<p>More reasons <a href="1135.html">not to panic</a> about poverty in America, <a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=9215">courtesy</a> of the Cato Institute:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's true that the share of national income going to the richest 20 percent of households rose from 43.6 percent in 1975 to 49.6 percent in 2006, the most recent year for which the Bureau of Labor Statistics has complete data. Meanwhile, families in the lowest fifth saw their piece of the pie fall from 4.3 percent to 3.3 percent.</p>
<p>Income statistics, however, don't tell the whole story of Americans' living standards. Looking at a far more direct measure of American families' economic status &#x2014; household consumption &#x2014; indicates that the gap between rich and poor is far less than most assume, and that the abstract, income-based way in which we measure the so-called poverty rate no longer applies to our society.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let's take the adjustments one step further. Richer households are larger &#x2014; an average of 3.1 people in the top fifth, compared with 2.5 people in the middle fifth and 1.7 in the bottom fifth. If we look at consumption per person, the difference between the richest and poorest households falls to just 2.1 to 1. The average person in the middle fifth consumes just 29 percent more than someone living in a bottom-fifth household.</p>

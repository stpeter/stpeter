<p>The Kennebec Journal recently <a href="http://www.centralmaine.com/news/local/287646.shtml">ran a story</a> about a nature preserve on Torsey Pond in Readfield, Maine. Why do I care? Because my mother donated the land for it. I first walked the property with my father soon after my parents purchased it, and it's a beautiful lot, sloping from the ridge down to the pond, with a fine boggy area on the lake that is home to many birds and other creatures. After my father died, my mother donated the land to the town of Readfield, and most recently volunteers have cut some trails so that future generations can enjoy this area. I'm looking forward to walking the land again next summer when I head up to Maine for a visit.</p>

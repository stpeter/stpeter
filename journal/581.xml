    <p>In the continuing conversation about what's wrong in the Jabber community, Peter Millard <a href="http://www.pgmillard.com/blog/index.php?p=23">observes</a>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We have protocol-incomplete implementations (servers and clients) because they are one-man projects! People implement what THEY think is important. If I'm the only contributor, then I will never implement what I don't think is important.</li>
      <li>Because we have one-man projects, we have crappy code documentation. The mentality here is: "If I'm not getting any source code contributions, then why bother documenting the code? No one other than me is going to read it."</li>
      <li>We have tons of clients because every one wants something different in a client, and most client owners are unwilling to allow "too" much intrusion into their own pet project. (Of course, I'm as guilty of this as the next person.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There's much truth here, I think. In a follow-up IM session, Peter further observed that in order to enable people to "scratch their itches", it's necessary for those working on existing projects to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>provide code that is hackable</li>
      <li>provide enough info about the code (where to find it, how to dive in, etc.)</li>
      <li>provide code that is modular enough so that people CAN jump in and contribute</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In other words, we don't have more contributors because <em>the barriers to entry are too high</em> and most coders don't have the time or energy to grok an entire, undocumented codebase before contributing. A further reason for the lack of contributors is that most Jabber projects (and probably most open-source projects) don't have well-defined roadmaps, so Joe Random Hacker doesn't have a good sense for what needs to be done and where he can most productively contribute.</p>
    <p>I once worked for a guy who did some projects for the 7-11 chain of convenience stores, and he used to say "There are no magic slurpies." Translation: there is no big drink that you can gulp down and everything will be fine. Solving these problems requires hard work, one project at a time. Projects that make it easy for other coders to contribute will thrive -- those that don't, won't. It's as simple as that. But well-designed, hackable, modular, fully-documented code doesn't grow on trees. It's hard work, and we'd be well served to dig in rather than just talking about it.</p>
    <p>Make that mantra #3: less yammering, more code!</p>

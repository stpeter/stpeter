<p>Have you ever noticed those people who live in their own reality, and who go through life as if they're the <a href='/music/hagiography/center.html'>center of the world</a>? Whether their act is being cool or earthy, macho or sweet, they're essentially pretending their way through life instead of authentically living it.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.kurtkeefner.com/'>Kurt Keefner</a> noticed, too, and instead of shrugging it off he thought about the phenomenon for years and eventually wrote a book about it, entitled <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Killing-Cool-Fantasy-Reality-American-ebook/dp/B00O4SNZGU'>Killing Cool: Fantasy vs. Reality in American Life</a>. I liked the book so much that I agreed to review it for <a href='http://reasonpapers.com/'>Reason Papers</a>. You can find my review <a href='http://reasonpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/rp_372_18.pdf'>here</a> (eventually I'll post it on my website, too, but until then I'd encourage you to check out Reason Papers because it's a fine journal).</p>
<p>UPDATE (2016-11-20): I've posted the <a href='/writings/essays/earnest.html'>HTML version</a> here on my website.</p>

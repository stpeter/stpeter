<p>Dave Winer <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2001/10/07/sevenYearsOfDavenet#journalism">says</a> that "journalism is a person writing a journal". I like that. I guess that makes any blogger into a journalist -- and often the amateurs (in the original sense of the word, of course) are more worth reading than the so-called professionals.</p>
<p><em>Blogito ergo sum -- I blog, therefore I am.</em> :)</p>

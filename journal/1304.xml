<p>Because I'm an admin of the jabber.org IM service, I can change people's passwords -- in fact I'm the official contact for such requests. What never ceases to amaze me is that I receive such requests from plenty of people whose IM accounts are not hosted at jabber.org, but instead at Google Talk, companies like FedEx and HP, even NASA. But just now I received a call that tops them all: someone at the <a href="http://www.disa.mil/">Defense Information Systems Agency</a> asked me if I could change their password. Um, no, I don't think I have access to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIPRNET">SIPRNet</a>. :)</p>

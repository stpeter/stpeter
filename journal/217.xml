<p>Thanks go to <a href="http://eliot.landrum.cx/journal/">Eliot</a> for a pointer to a <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2002/04/22#flyingWithBothWings">blog entry</a> by Doc Searls on political labels. It seems that Doc is something of a left-libertarian, too, though he feels labels are not very helpful. I must agree. While I've somewhat settled on the term "progressive libertarian", even that doesn't quite capture my thinking about politics (which in turn is downstream from more deeply-held ideas). Given my view that labels don't tend to be fully descriptive, it's ironic that some people know me mainly for <a href="/writings/ismbook/">The Ism Book</a>, which carefully catalogues all the various pigeonholes of philosophical discourse. Probably one reason I haven't updated that resource since 1996 is that I don't find the activity of fitting square pegs into round holes all that satisfying any longer. But I really do need to complete a good once-over on the Ism Book, since I'm rather embarrassed by much of it now. Maybe by the end of 2002 I'll get around to it....</p>

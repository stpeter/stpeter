<p>The great jazz pianist Oscar Peterson passed away recently, so I thought I would mention my favorite of his recordings: <a href="http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=3297">Live at the Northsea Jazz Festival</a>. This 1980 session had a bit of an unusual lineup: Peterson, Niels-Henning Orsted-Pedersen on bass, the great Joe Pass on guitar, and Toots Thielemans on harmonica. The playing is extremely conversational, almost contrapuntal, throughout. I especially love their twelve-minute performance of Duke Ellington's <em>Caravan</em>. Check it out!</p>

<p>I've been emailing a bit with <a href="http://www.jilk.com/">Dave Jilk</a> about his essay on the nature of entities. In thinking about a few points, I dove into my ancient copy of Rand's <cite>Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology</cite> (the old, small-form paperback edition, rather than the expanded second edition), and therein I found some notes I'd made regarding similarities and differences between art and language. One thing led to another and soon I found myself re-writing from scratch an essay I started many years ago entitled "The Conceptual Nature of Art". When not working on Jabber of late, I've been devoting time and thought to this essay, which consists in something of a reconstruction of Ayn Rand's philosophy of art. Stay tuned for the final version.</p>

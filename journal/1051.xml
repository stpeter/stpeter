    <p>I have little time for blogging these days, but I must note <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2007/02/09/no_change_in_political_climate/">this quote</a> from one Ellen Goodman:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Let's just say that global warming deniers are now on a par with Holocaust deniers, though one denies the past and the other denies the present and future.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The best rebuttals I've read so far are by <a href="http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=021407D">Arnold Kling</a> and <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/commentary/20070211-102909-1378r.htm">Mark Steyn</a>. If it weren't for the fact that you can't deny something that hasn't happened yet, I'd say consider me a climate holocaust denier.</p>

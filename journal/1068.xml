    <p>I just added two more words to <a href="http://wordie.org/people/stpeter">my Wordie list</a>: <a href="http://wordie.org/words/omphaloskepsis">omphaloskepsis</a> and <a href="http://wordie.org/words/ultracrepidarian">ultracrepidarian</a>. Are they cool or what?</p>
    <p>Omphaloskepsis comes from the ancient Greek words for navel and sight, thus resulting in a fancy word for navel-gazing.</p>
    <p>The roots of ultracrepidarian are a bit more complex (well-explained <a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-ult1.htm">here</a>), but the meaning has more bite: "going beyond one's area of knowledge". Thus we could say that Al Gore was a classic ultracrepidarian when he made "An Inconvenient Truth" &mdash; just because he <a href="571.html">invented the Internet</a> doesn't mean he's an expert on climatology. ;-)</p>

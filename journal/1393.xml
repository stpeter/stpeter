<p>While uploading a new file to the <a href="http://www.monadnock.net/">Monadnock Press</a> website just now (<a href="http://www.monadnock.net/whitman/leaves.html">Leaves of Grass</a>, if you're curious), I realized that today's date (2010-01-02) is palindromic. The next palindromic date will be 2011-11-02, after which we'll have to wait until 2020-02-02. We'll see if anyone notices, then... :)</p>

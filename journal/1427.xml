<p>Inspired by reading Tufte, I've decided to simplify the appearance of my blog. So far I've installed a new WordPress theme (<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/zbench">zbench</a>) and I've removed various pages and images that were cluttering things up. Further simplification might be on the way. :)</p>

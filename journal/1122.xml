<p>One could argue that there have been three phases of Anglosphere expansion: from England outward into the rest of the British Isles, from the British Isles outward to North America, and from the British Isles (and North America) outward to Australasia, the Caribbean, India, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Right now I'm reading three books related to the second expansion:</p>
<ul>
<li><cite>The Cabot Voyages and Bristol Discovery under Henry VII</cite> by J.A. Williamson (Cambridge University Press, 1962)</li>
<li><cite>The European Discovery of America</cite> by S.E. Morison (Oxford University Press, 1971)</li>
<li><cite>England and the Discovery of America, 1481-1620</cite> by David Beers Quinn (Knopf, 1974)</li>
</ul>
<p>Expect a more complete report soon. The short version: there is much reason for us North Americans to celebrate <a href="810.html">Cabot Day</a> instead of Columbus Day.</p>

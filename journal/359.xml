<p>Recently I posted about "PTs" (perpetual travelers, permanent tourists, etc.), who never put down roots in once place and thus live a life of freedom from interference by meddling snoops and such. Another lifestyle choice is akin to living as a modern-day Thoreau. It seems that Claire Wolfe, whose <a href="http://www.clairewolfe.com/blog.html">weblog</a> I recently added to my shortlist, <a href="http://www.clairewolfe.com/wolfesblog/archives/00000037.html">lives in this manner</a>. I have to respect her for building her own cabin in the woods, simplifying her life down to the bare essentials, refusing government identity numbers, and so on.</p>

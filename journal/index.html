<h2><a href="1579.html">Thoreau on Genius</a></h2>
<h3>2017-02-04</h3>
<p>Someone who knows that I'm writing a book on Thoreau sent me a link from BrainPickings.org about Thoreau's views on the topic of genius. Drawing on the "Thursday" and "Friday" chapters of <cite>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers</cite>, the author focuses her brief essay on the difference between an artisan, an artist, and a genius.</p>
<p>Although that's fine as far as it goes, the word "genius" meant something more significant - and more ancient - for Thoreau than it does for us. When we think of geniuses, we think of really smart and inventive people like Albert Einstein. Yet for Thoreau, every person has a genius: "There has been no man of pure Genius; as there has been none wholly destitute of Genius." The key is a derivation from the Roman idea of your good genius, which borrowed directly from the even older Greek notion of your daimon - that is, your conscience, your higher self, your inner god, the aspect of your personality that partakes in the divine.</p>
<p>Consider a few quotes from <cite>Walden</cite>. In "Higher Laws", Thoreau writes:</p>
<blockquote>If one listens to the faintest but constant suggestions of his genius, which are certainly true, he sees not to what extremes, or even insanity, it may lead him; and yet that way, as he grows more resolute and faithful, his road lies. The faintest assured objection which one healthy man feels will at length prevail over the arguments and customs of mankind. No man ever followed his genius till it misled him.</blockquote>
<p>And in "Sounds":</p>
<blockquote>I had this advantage, at least, in my mode of life, over those who were obliged to look abroad for amusement, to society and the theatre, that my life itself was become my amusement and never ceased to be novel.  It was a drama of many scenes and without an end. If we were always, indeed, getting our living, and regulating our lives according to the last and best mode we had learned, we should never be troubled with ennui. Follow your genius closely enough, and it will not fail to show you a fresh prospect every hour.</blockquote>
<p>In "Economy", Thoreau makes explicit the connection between genius and independence:</p>
<blockquote>I was more independent than any farmer in Concord, for I was not anchored to a house or farm, but could follow the bent of my genius, which is a very crooked one, every moment.</blockquote>
<p>At root, then, for Thoreau genius is not a matter of intellectual brilliance but of following your own path to the higher ground of your upland farm.</p>

<h2><a href="1578.html">HTTPS No More</a></h2>
<h3>2017-02-02</h3>
<p>One unfortunate byproduct of shutting down my VPS and moving my websites to GitHub Pages is that I'm no longer hosting the stpeter.im domain via HTTPS. Although I'm not overjoyed about this, I'm also not deeply disturbed by it given that my personal website isn't exactly the kind of information that needs to be encrypted in transit (and someone could retrieve it over HTTPS from GitHub.com if they really wanted to). Mike Linksvayer helpfully pointed out to me that there are some solutions, and I'll look into those soon. In the meantime I've modified all the cross-links within my websites so that they use http instead of https URLs.</p>

<h2><a href="1577.html">VPS No More</a></h2>
<h3>2017-02-01</h3>
<p>A few weeks ago I spent most of a Sunday trying, and failing, to upgrade the Debian Linux distribution on my virtual private server (VPS). After the Linux experts at my hosting company also failed after 90 minutes of fighting with the thing, I realized that the time had come to shut down my VPS and find simpler solutions. For me, that turned out to be FastMail for my email addresses and GitHub Pages for my websites (I was also hosting a few WordPress sites for friends, which I've moved to WordPress.com). The only things I miss at this point are HTTPS for one of my websites, and the personal XMPP server I was running. Yet the HTTPS wasn't really all that critical (I know, HTTPS Everywhere and all that, but in practice I'm not running transactional websites and in fact all of my sites are even free of JavaScript - I guess I'm a Web 1.0 kind of person). And although the XMPP server was a fine thing, I do run jabber.org and I've had a few addresses there forever, so I might as well use them. Simplify, simplify!</p>

<h2><a href="1576.html">Poets' Paradox</a></h2>
<h3>2017-01-31</h3>
<p>Here's another draft poem for my far-future book <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Poets' Paradox</strong><br><br>
Hearken how he says, in verse,<br>
That the poets always lie - or worse,<br>
To their everlasting shame,<br>
That they ever vie for petty fame.
<br><br>
Their unbounded vanity<br>
Leads them far from piety;<br>
They live not the holy writ<br>
Whose deed is but to utter it.
</blockquote>
<p>I think this might make a fine opening salvo, with its Nietzschean questioning of the entire enterprise of writing a cycle of poems about a poetic philosopher. The reference to the Cretan Paradox merely adds to the fun.</p>

<h2><a href="1575.html">Ism Book Updates</a></h2>
<h3>2017-01-29</h3>
<p>One of the great things about publishing to the Internet, and nowadays print on demand as well, is that you can continually improve what you have written. Among my writings, there is no better example than <cite>The Ism Book: A Field Guide to Philosophy</cite>. I first wrote this highly interlinked book using HyperCard on my first Macintosh computer, then ported it to the Internet in 1996. Since then it has undergone numerous revisions as I've broadened and deepened my understanding of philosophical history and concepts. Last week while in flight to and from California I marked up a copy of the book with copious amounts of red ink, and today I keyed in a large number of edits (in fact I've been making numerous fixes for the last two months). Now I just need to port all these changes over to the physical book and republish it.</p>

<h2><a href="1574.html">The Irrelevance of Government</a></h2>
<h3>2017-01-21</h3>
<p>Imagine life a thousand years ago in, say, France or Italy. The society and culture in which you are immersed is deeply focused on religion. The words of your local priest have great significance, a bishop or archbishop is a personage of divine importance, and the Pope is like a spiritual emperor. Those wishing to effect social change, or tell other people what to do, or pursue their own personal advantage, necessarily use the tool that is ready to hand, and that is the apparatus of the church.</p>
<p>Now imagine that somehow you conclude that God does not exist. Everything around you and within you would resist this notion. You would feel utterly isolated from your fellow men. If you dared to express this heretical thought, immediately and from all sides would come objections that the church, the Pope, the monasteries, the saints and martyrs, and the very order of nature and society disprove you. And then most likely you would be burned at the stake.</p>
<p>It seems to me that we are at the same place with regard to the state: governments are all around us; mayors and governors and senators hold great power; the President is practically a secular emperor. Those wishing to effect social change, or tell other people what to do, or pursue their own personal advantage, necessarily use the tool that is ready to hand, and that is the apparatus of government.</p>
<p>Yet does the state really exist as an independent entity? Or is it just that generations of individuals, working together, have built up an apparatus of temporal power, just as generations of individuals, working together, previously built up an apparatus of spiritual power?</p>
<p>I wonder.</p>
<p>It is extremely difficult in today's society to break out of a state-centric worldview, to recognize that perhaps there is a right to ignore the state (as Herbert Spencer once put it), to consider the apparatus of government as a primitive superstition, to judge those who use that apparatus (no matter what their ends and intentions) as misguided or immoral, and to treat government as irrelevant to life - to be, in short, a non-statist and thus similar in one's social philosophy to the non-theists I wrote about a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>I cannot say that I have quite concluded that the state does not exist, although I've been toying with the idea for a long time - and the more I ponder it and the more experience I have of a state-centric society the more plausible it seems. That doesn't mean I have figured out how a fully voluntary society could be turned into a practical reality! Yet I would agree with Ursula K. Le Guin, who once said of her anarchist novel <cite>The Dispossessed</cite> that it presents "a necessary ideal"; for without the ideal of truly voluntary interactions among free people, life would feel awfully dark at times.</p>

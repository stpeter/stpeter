<h2><a href="1577.html">VPS No More</a></h2>
<h3>2017-02-01</h3>
<p>A few weeks ago I spent most of a Sunday trying, and failing, to upgrade the Debian Linux distribution on my virtual private server (VPS). After the Linux experts at my hosting company also failed after 90 minutes of fighting with the thing, I realized that the time had come to shut down my VPS and find simpler solutions. For me, that turned out to be FastMail for my email addresses and GitHub Pages for my websites (I was also hosting a few WordPress sites for friends, which I've moved to WordPress.com). The only things I miss at this point are HTTPS for one of my websites, and the personal XMPP server I was running. Yet the HTTPS wasn't really all that critical (I know, HTTPS Everywhere and all that, but in practice I'm not running transactional websites and in fact all of my sites are even free of JavaScript - I guess I'm a Web 1.0 kind of person). And although the XMPP server was a fine thing, I do run jabber.org and I've had a few addresses there forever, so I might as well use them. Simplify, simplify!</p>

<h2><a href="1576.html">Poets' Paradox</a></h2>
<h3>2017-01-31</h3>
<p>Here's another draft poem for my far-future book <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Poets' Paradox</strong><br><br>
Hearken how he says, in verse,<br>
That the poets always lie - or worse,<br>
To their everlasting shame,<br>
That they ever vie for petty fame.
<br><br>
Their unbounded vanity<br>
Leads them far from piety;<br>
They live not the holy writ<br>
Whose deed is but to utter it.
</blockquote>
<p>I think this might make a fine opening salvo, with its Nietzschean questioning of the entire enterprise of writing a cycle of poems about a poetic philosopher. The reference to the Cretan Paradox merely adds to the fun.</p>

<h2><a href="1575.html">Ism Book Updates</a></h2>
<h3>2017-01-29</h3>
<p>One of the great things about publishing to the Internet, and nowadays print on demand as well, is that you can continually improve what you have written. Among my writings, there is no better example than <cite>The Ism Book: A Field Guide to Philosophy</cite>. I first wrote this highly interlinked book using HyperCard on my first Macintosh computer, then ported it to the Internet in 1996. Since then it has undergone numerous revisions as I've broadened and deepened my understanding of philosophical history and concepts. Last week while in flight to and from California I marked up a copy of the book with copious amounts of red ink, and today I keyed in a large number of edits (in fact I've been making numerous fixes for the last two months). Now I just need to port all these changes over to the physical book and republish it.</p>

<h2><a href="1574.html">The Irrelevance of Government</a></h2>
<h3>2017-01-21</h3>
<p>Imagine life a thousand years ago in, say, France or Italy. The society and culture in which you are immersed is deeply focused on religion. The words of your local priest have great significance, a bishop or archbishop is a personage of divine importance, and the Pope is like a spiritual emperor. Those wishing to effect social change, or tell other people what to do, or pursue their own personal advantage, necessarily use the tool that is ready to hand, and that is the apparatus of the church.</p>
<p>Now imagine that somehow you conclude that God does not exist. Everything around you and within you would resist this notion. You would feel utterly isolated from your fellow men. If you dared to express this heretical thought, immediately and from all sides would come objections that the church, the Pope, the monasteries, the saints and martyrs, and the very order of nature and society disprove you. And then most likely you would be burned at the stake.</p>
<p>It seems to me that we are at the same place with regard to the state: governments are all around us; mayors and governors and senators hold great power; the President is practically a secular emperor. Those wishing to effect social change, or tell other people what to do, or pursue their own personal advantage, necessarily use the tool that is ready to hand, and that is the apparatus of government.</p>
<p>Yet does the state really exist as an independent entity? Or is it just that generations of individuals, working together, have built up an apparatus of temporal power, just as generations of individuals, working together, previously built up an apparatus of spiritual power?</p>
<p>I wonder.</p>
<p>It is extremely difficult in today's society to break out of a state-centric worldview, to recognize that perhaps there is a right to ignore the state (as Herbert Spencer once put it), to consider the apparatus of government as a primitive superstition, to judge those who use that apparatus (no matter what their ends and intentions) as misguided or immoral, and to treat government as irrelevant to life - to be, in short, a non-statist and thus similar in one's social philosophy to the non-theists I wrote about a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>I cannot say that I have quite concluded that the state does not exist, although I've been toying with the idea for a long time - and the more I ponder it and the more experience I have of a state-centric society the more plausible it seems. That doesn't mean I have figured out how a fully voluntary society could be turned into a practical reality! Yet I would agree with Ursula K. Le Guin, who once said of her anarchist novel <cite>The Dispossessed</cite> that it presents "a necessary ideal"; for without the ideal of truly voluntary interactions among free people, life would feel awfully dark at times.</p>

<h2><a href="1573.html">There's Never Just One Cause</a></h2>
<h3>2017-01-20</h3>
<p>Some years ago I did some intensive research into the origins of the industrial revolution. At the time I was working my way out of the Rand meme, so the starting point of my investigation was her assertion that the cause of the industrial revolution was the philosophy of Aristotle. My conclusion was that Rand was wrong, and that there were multiple causes involved. I presented the fruits of my research in a paper published by the UK Libertarian Alliance, entitled <cite>Ayn Rand and the Ascent of Man</cite>.</p>
<p>A deeper conclusion I drew is that <em>there's never just one cause</em> for any complex phenomenon. For instance, my skepticism about the popular account of global warming (now "climate change") is that saying human activity is the only cause has to be an over-simplification - the climate of Earth is an immensely complex system that we have only begun to understand.</p>
<p>As another example, consider the mortgage crisis of 2008-2009 (and associated stock market crash and economic recession); depending on the ideological axe being ground, various observers blamed President Bush, President Clinton, Alan Greenspan, investment banks, mortgage originators, the rating agencies, the Federal Reserve, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Community Reinvestment Act, poor people who couldn't afford the houses they were buying, etc. Yet in any widespread madness such as the mortgage frenzy of the mid-2000s you can be sure that there were many factors, not just one.</p>
<p>Given that President Trump was inaugurated today, I might as well point out that it's sheer folly to claim he was elected solely because of rampant racism, sexism, and bigotry. Many people who voted for Obama the second time around switched their votes to Trump or refused to vote, third-party voting totals increased, Hillary was a horrendous candidate, lots of folks are members of political parties and vote by rote for whatever candidate is offered up, etc. I'm no fan of Trump (having voted for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson), but saying that there was just one cause for Trump's election within a populace of 300+ million people is silly.</p>
<p>By the way, this kind of thinking shows up in libertarian circles, too: I've definitely heard people of a libertarian persuasion essentially say that everything bad in the world is caused by government, and that if only we could minimize government or get rid of it entirely, everything would be wonderful. I have news for you: there are many causes of the ills we find in human societies (economic, cultural, ethical, etc.), and overweening governments are only one of them.</p>
<p>Although I'm not generally a skeptic, I am definitely skeptical about causal monism.</p>

<h2><a href="1572.html">Monadnock Valley Press Annual Report 2016</a></h2>
<h3>2017-01-14</h3>
<p>In 2016 I again spent very little time on posting public-domain texts at the Monadnock Valley Press - only a few works by Henry David Thoreau, Virginia Woolf, and Blaise Pascal. Once I finish my forthcoming book on Thoreau, I plan to clear out a backlog of books, essays, and plays by Ibsen, Confucius, Emerson, Montaigne, Spinoza, Petrarch, Lucretius, Epictetus, Seneca, and Cicero. With revenue of $248.62 and expenses of $181.58, we earned only $67.04 in 2016, too. It's a good thing I don't write philosophy books for the money!</p>

<h3>2019-05-15</h3>
<p>In <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> X.7, Aristotle mentions almost in passing that "we engage in unleisured pursuits so that we may be at leisure" (1177b5). In <cite>Politics</cite> Book VIII, where he discusses the role of music in human life, he expands on this idea:</p>
<blockquote>Nature itself strives not only to be busy in the right way but also to be capable of being at leisure in a beautiful way. For this one principle governs everything, so let us speak about it again. If one has need of both, but being at leisure is more worthy of choice and more an end than being busy, what needs to be sought out is what one ought to spend one's leisure doing. (1337b28-33)</blockquote>
<p>Aristotle goes on to explore why educators specifically introduced music into the curriculum for young people, concluding that "it is for that part of life one spends in leisure", which is "the way of life suited to free people" (1338a20-25). Thus "music is to be used to enhance the joy of living and a way of life suited to freedom" (1339b4-5).</p>
<p>He makes a similar argument with regard to the love of wisdom (i.e., philosophy) and intellectual work in general: it is serious, inquisitive, self-contained, innately enjoyable, and leisurely.</p>
<p>In her book <cite>Aristotle and the Philosophy of Friendship</cite>, Lorraine Smith Pangle provides a beautiful summary of Aristotle's insights here:</p>
<blockquote>Most of us do not spend much time cultivating activities that are good in themselves and not frivolous, but we do recognize them: music, good conversation, gazing into a lover's eyes, learning and contemplating what we know, a quiet, deep enjoyment of what is beautiful. Most of us are too restless and too lazy to spend much time in such pursuits. We are ourselves not talented or accomplished in the arts, and being a spectator is less satisfying than being actively engaged in them. We find thinking difficult and unpleasant, and we are too agitated to contemplate anything for long. We need problems to tackle and common enemies to fight to give depth to our friendships, exams to take and performances to give to keep us learning and practicing, courses to teach and publication deadlines to keep us thinking. But all of these things are ultimately crutches and should be frankly regarded as such.</blockquote>
<p>As David Roochnik notes in <cite>Retrieving Aristotle in an Age of Crisis</cite>, the Greek word for leisure is, ironically, σχολή - the root of our English words school and scholar. Yet nowadays we find nothing restful about schooling and scholarship. By contrast, although Aristotle was incredibly productive, he held that true learning emerges from a more leisurely approach, driven not by the desire for honors or money or fame but by the sheer love of inquiry and creativity. Naturally, few people have the requisite financial means or psychological makeup to live that way, but more fundamentally it is an ideal that we have almost completely lost touch with. The grievous effects of that loss are all around us.</p>

<h2><a href="1627.html">Tales of Slow Time</a></h2>
<h3>2019-04-28</h3>
<p>I've been thinking about writing a set of linked short stories entitled <cite>Tales of Slow Time</cite>, set in the early 22nd century. As I see it, this will be a time of extremely rapid change and constant flux. Because humans won't be able to absorb change at that rate, they will be even further dumbed down and domesticated compared to today, living as they will in a culture of convenience, pleasure, entertainment, and post-literacy. The influence of raw intelligence will be even more keenly felt (cf. the seven tribes), resulting in extreme inequality. Governments everywhere will have implemented a universal basic income to placate the great mass of people who would otherwise have no livelihood. However, most people will therefore have too much free time: some will use that time to cause trouble, meddle, protest; others will play immersive video games or plug into virtual worlds; others will engage in simulacra of productivity (incubators of nothing). The human population will be both smaller and older. Information technology will be pervasive: robots will perform many routine and non-routine tasks; algorithms will rule the day; people will be subject to ubiquitous tracking, profiling, surveillance, and manipulation through advertising, marketing, nudging, and helpthink; we will experience the gamification of all activities and human/machine interactions; news, information, audio, video, AR/VR, holography - anything presented or represented through networks or computers - will be essentially made up (fiat everything); people will have little certainty about what is real. Everything and everyone will be mapped, tracked, annotated, recorded via the hypermap and the ledger. Robots will be our friends and teachers; machines will perceive our moods; all of our choices will be "suggested" by algorithms. Corporations and governments will engage in lifelong observation and manipulation of each and every individual. There will be no privacy, no autonomy, no serenity, no humanity. We will live in a materially abundant spiritual wasteland ruled by impersonal forces of government, science, technology, corporations, insurers, medicine, politics, even the arts.</p>
<p>But there will be a significant minority of refuseniks, called slowtimers, who will prefer to interact in human ways, unmediated by computers and robots and algorithms. Slowtimers will do things in old-fashioned ways: they will prefer bicycling and walking; engage in farming, gardening, and cooking; cultivate the arts of reading and conversation; pursue careers and hobbies as artists and craftspeople and storytellers and tinkerers; labor in cooperatives and other human-scale organizations; produce live music, plays, dance, readings, and other in-person events that can’t be faked; feel a veneration for what is old (rivers, trees, mountains, temples, festivals, pubs, books, music, wisdom); create structures, establish institutions, and plant things that are designed to last. Slowtimers will persist in all parts of the world and will be variously tolerated, segregated into certain localities, even forced onto reservations. They will exist in shadowy areas on the hypermap where people mostly live off-ledger with no Internet and no computers, communicating in person and by pre-net methods like radio and letter. Slowtimer communities will prize localism and will be largely self-sufficient. Religions and philosophies of various kinds will play a prominent role through contemplation, retreats, churches, prayer, and liturgical time. Although I associate slow time especially with Taoism, slowtimers will cleave to no one creed because there are many varieties of personalism. Slowtimers will seek out deeply active and personal antidotes to impersonalism: callings and creative pursuits, close relationships, learning and inquiry, involvement in community, and the like. They will also seek longevity not through pills and advanced medical technologies (and the intrusive monitoring that big data requires), but by slowing down the experience of life, by living authentically, and by treasuring each moment of existence.</p>
<p>There will be many sources of conflict between the fast world of the future and the slowtimers who live within it. A coordinated array of impersonal forces will make life hard for slowtimers by denying them job opportunities, advanced technologies, insurance, government benefits, medical care, the ability to travel, even the right to equal justice under the law. All too often, slowtimers will be treated as subversives and enemies of the people; in order to survive, they will need to develop alternative economic and political structures based on mutual aid and free association, such as fraternal societies and cooperatives. The physical and emotional borders between fast and slow will be difficult and even dangerous to navigate (how do you transfer wealth from the monitored economy to the free economy? what happens if the child of slowtimer parents wishes to join the fast world? what heartbreak ensues when a fasttimer falls in love with a slowtimer? etc.).</p>
<p>As with any small group, slowtimers will be subject to infighting and schisms, which will be exploited ruthlessly by the authorities. But maybe, just maybe, by thinking eternally and acting presently they will find a way to overcome the forces of impersonalism and build a more human world. They'd better, because they're our only hope.</p>

<h2><a href="1626.html">Aristotle's Way: A Review</a></h2>
<h3>2019-04-28</h3>
<p>There is much to like about <cite>Aristotle's Way</cite>, a new book by Edith Hall subtitled "How Ancient Wisdom Can Change Your Life". Hall does an excellent job of showing how Aristotle is still relevant today, which she does by drawing a sympathetic picture of ancient ways of life, by describing how she has applied Aristotelian insights in her own life, and by using examples drawn from contemporary fiction and film. Her explanations of Aristotle's views on human action and character are engaging and, for the most part, accurate. She even gives due consideration to Aristotle's biological works and to the <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite>, the often-ignored little brother of Aristotle's <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>.</p>
<p>I do have a few quibbles. Some of her extrapolations regarding how Aristotle might have felt back then, or what he might do were he alive today, strike me as fanciful. She engages in more politically correct virtue signalling than I would like (does a book on the deep and timeless philosophy of Aristotle need to include a British classicist's effusions over Barack Obama or her denigration of "climate change deniers"?). And several of her personal examples, while charming, are pursued at greater length than necessary.</p>
<p>More seriously, Hall misses the mark on a few key aspects of Aristotle's philosophy. For instance, she considers self-restraint to be a virtue, whereas Aristotle repeatedly says that a person of excellent character will not experience the sort of feelings (say, excessive anger or inappropriate sexual desire) that would necessitate self-restraint in the first place. Because ἀρετή is a matter of balanced action <em>and</em> reaction, the self-restrained person (ἐγκρατής), while well-behaved, is not completely good.</p>
<p>Furthermore and most fundamentally, she misrepresents Aristotle's conception of eudaimonia, which she translates as "happiness". As I shall explore at length in my forthcoming book <cite>Complete Yourself</cite>, for Aristotle εὐδαιμονία is the practice and activity of living well, not a feeling of subjective well-being. Hall, taking seriously our present-day conception of happiness as contentment or enjoyment, makes Aristotle relevant to people today but at the cost of trivializing his abiding contribution to the philosophical understanding of human flourishing. I, by contrast, recognizing how trivial our present-day conception of happiness is in many ways, will aim to show that Aristotle's deepest insights are relevant to serious people of all times. Hall democratizes Aristotle and thus brings him down to the level of the average person today by making him out to be a kind of self-help guru; although she meets you where you are, I will encourage you (even at the risk of sounding like an ethical elitist) to raise yourself up to Aristotle's level and thus to join the aristocracy of the human spirit.</p>
<p>All told, though, I recommend <cite>Aristotle's Way</cite> as a welcome contribution to the modern-day dialogue on the good life.</p>

<h2><a href="1625.html">Never Finished</a></h2>
<h3>2019-03-07</h3>
<p>Last weekend I went to an exhibit related to Leonardo da Vinci at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. Amidst the reconstructions of his inventions and at the entrance to a whole room about the Mona Lisa I came across this quote: "Art is never finished, only abandoned." Although it's not clear to me if Leonardo actually said that (Vasari mentions something similar in his <cite>Life</cite> of Leonardo), I like the sentiment.</p>
<p>Lately I've been revisiting the short books I've written on Rand, Epicurus, Thoreau, and Nietzsche, improving the wording here and there (as described in a blog post entitled "Poetry as Code", in 2017 I did the same thing with my collection of poems and poetry translations). One great thing about self-directed, online publishing is that it's easy to keep tweaking: just check some changes into GitHub and a minute or two later the world sees a better version.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, my poem "Twilight Dance" in <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite>. It's about Nietzsche's love of both life and wisdom, so I wrote it in Sapphic meter. Unfortunately, the original version had clunky rhythms and didn't really sing. Let's compare the second stanza to see what I mean. Originally it went as follows:</p>
<p>
These two loves of mine are very much alike:<br>
They're changeable, untamed, wicked, even false --<br>
A fountain of delight and shower of pain<br>
To my highest hopes.
</p>
<p>Here's the improved version:</p>
<p>
These two loves of mine are very much alike:<br>
Fickle, wicked, mocking, coy, unconquered, cruel --<br>
Fountains of delight and showers of distress<br>
To my highest hope.
</p>
<p>I especially like the second line: seven instances of the "k" sound in eleven syllables. That really packs a punch!</p>

<h2><a href="1624.html">Aristotle Research Report #9: τέλος</a></h2>
<h3>2019-03-07</h3>
<p>Part of my goal in writing an epitome of Aristotle's writings on personal excellence is to get closer to their original meaning, which I do by reflecting deeply on how to render crucial Greek words into English. Consider this cluster: τέλος, τελεία, τελειώτατον. In his book <cite>Aristotle on the Human Good</cite>, Richard Kraut translates them with variations on the English word "perfection". In present-day English, "perfect" has connotations of being absolutely without blemish; thus something perfect seems static and cold and unchanging, not dynamic and warm and living. I get a distinctly unworldly (dare I say Platonic?) feeling from Kraut's translation. Yet in Greek τέλος is something much simpler: the end-marker or finish-line of a racecourse. A τέλος is a goal; you can achieve a goal or complete a race, but you don't perfect a goal or perfect a race. Similarly with τελεία: Aristotle speaks of τελεία ἀρετή, which I would render as complete excellence (not "perfect virtue"). So also with τελειώτατον: in his analysis of εὐδαιμονία or living well Aristotle mentions that the highest goal of human action needs to be the most complete (not "most perfect") because if you could add anything more to it then there would be a more valuable goal. In all of these instances, I am tempted to find the idea of "completing" or "most completing" behind the scenes; in Aristotle's philosophy, the concept of ἐντελέχεια (becoming complete, achieving a goal, completing a task) is always central. And note that the task (ἔργον) you're working at (ἐνέργεια) is not imposed from outside but grows organically from within; Aristotle's teleology (there's that τέλος again) is not universal but particular, individual, personal. Thus my working title: <cite>Complete Yourself</cite>.</p>
<p>(On a related note, I often find it tiresome to read the secondary literature on Aristotle because if the scholar in question interprets key terms in an utterly different way than I do, then I need to mentally translate everything back to my own conceptual space as I read; absorbing hundreds of pages in which ἀρεταί ἠθικαί comes through as "moral virtue" instead of "excellence of character" is a chore!)</p>

<h2><a href="1623.html">Aristotle Research Report #8: σοφία</a></h2>
<h3>2019-02-18</h3>
<p>In Book V of the <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite> [1], Aristotle discusses the excellences of thinking things through (ἀρεταί διανοετικαί, usually translated as "the intellectual virtues"), in contrast to the excellences of character or ἀρεταί ἠθικαί. Recently I wrote about the more practical of the two primary excellences of thought: φρόνησις (which I translate as "wisdom"). Here I take a first glance at the more theoretical of the two: σοφία.</p>
<p>It's hard to know to translate this one. Although σοφία was itself wisdom in Greek philosophy (a.k.a. "the love of wisdom"), Aristotle gives it a more speculative cast here. I'm inclined to translate it as "sagacity".</p>
<p>Although both wisdom and sagacity are supposed to be ἀρεταί and thus balances or means between opposing tendencies to overdo or underdo the relevant behavior, only once (in the EE but not the NE) does Aristotle lay out those tendencies and only for φρόνησις, which as previously noted he describes as a mean between cunning and foolishness. Because he does not do the same for σοφία, we need to figure it out on our own.</p>
<p>Using Gilbert Ryle's distinction between knowing how and knowing that, we can glean that foolishness is an absolute lack of knowing how, whereas cunning is knowing how without the benefit of insight into or guidance by what is best - i.e., τό καλόν or what is beautifully right. Similarly, the deficiency of sagacity is most likely ignorance: the absolute lack of knowing that; this might imply that the other opposite of sagacity is knowing that without the benefit of insight into or guidance by what is best - i.e., τό θείον or the divine, which for Aristotle consists of the highest objects of inquiry (θεωρία). In ancient Greece, there's one word for this corruption (μοχθηρία) of the intellect: sophism.</p>
<p>This analysis is consistent with Aristotle's brief description of sagacity as a combination of inquiry (θεωρία) and insight (νοῦς). Unfortunately, Aristotle does not delve into a detailed description of σοφία. However, he does demonstrate many aspects of intellectual excellence in the way he works through philosophical problems. Here we can see his perseverence, his dedication to observation, his openness to evidence, his curiosity, his conscientiousness, his pursuit of order, his independence, his seriousness, his fairness to other thinkers, his love of truth, and other admirable qualities. A full account of σοφία or sagacity would do justice to these and other intellectual virtues.</p>
<p><em>NOTES</em></p>
<p>[1] This is also Book VI of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>; henceforth, accepting the results of Anthony Kenny's research, I shall refer to the so-called "Common Books" by their numbering in the <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite>.</p>

<h2><a href="1632.html">Cooperative Thinking</a></h2>
<h3>2019-08-16</h3>
<p>A few years ago I did a bunch of research and thinking about alternative forms of organizational structure, focused especially on cooperatives (at the time I was thinking about setting up a co-op to run the Jabber.org messaging service). The approach I found most interesting was funding a co-op through something called a direct public offering. This can be done for much less money and with much greater control than VC funding or angel investing or whatever - it's basically a kind of more advanced crowdfunding. Companies that have done this include My Trail (an outdoor clothing company in Boulder, Colorado), Real Pickles (a food co-op in Massachusetts), and Equal Exchange (the original fair trade coffee company, also located in Massachusetts). Other co-ops I investigated are self-funded and haven't pursued the DPO route (e.g., Namasté Solar, Plausible Labs, and Isthmus Engineering)</p>
<p>My conclusion at the time was that it would be best to start out by self-financing the co-op - either alone or with a few partners who also put in sweat equity (i.e., a workers' cooperative) - and then pursue a DPO once you have a going concern. If I recall correctly, this might even be required depending on the state you're in. DPOs are regulated at the state level, which is how they avoid the expense of SEC compliance, but this also means that you can only solicit investors in that state. For example, MyTrail solicited investors only in Colorado. However, it's good to know that Colorado has something of a model legal structure for cooperatives.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I'll ever do anything with the information I gathered, but a few folks have asked me about it over the years so I figured I'd at least make it available here for posterity.</p>

<h2><a href="1631.html">Hummus Recipe</a></h2>
<h3>2019-07-21</h3>
<p>One of my favorite things to eat in the summer (and in truth all year round) is hummus. Because multiple people have requested my recipe over the years, I figured I'd share it here.</p>
<p>Here are the ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>15 oz garbanzo beans</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic</li>
<li>pinch cayenne</li>
<li>2 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
<li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
<li>1/4 cup tahini</li>
<li>1/8 cup water</li>
</ul>
<p>Place all ingredients in a food processor and process for 10-15 seconds. That's it!</p>
<p>I like my hummus thick, garlicky, and chunky - if your preferences differ, increase the water, cut back on the garlic, and increase the processing time.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h2><a href="1630.html">Aristotle Research Report #11: εὐπραξία</a></h2>
<h3>2019-07-07</h3>
<p>One of the lesser-known terms in Aristotle's ethical treatises is εὐπραξία (eupraxia) along with its sister εὐπραγία (eupragia). Both terms mean doing well, faring well, having success. Aristotle's use is connected to εὐδαιμονία, which he defines as "living well and doing well" (τὸ εὖ ζῆν καὶ τὸ εὖ πράττειν). But what are the metrics for "success" here? He leaves us several clues. First is the verb πράττειν, which for Aristotle means not merely engaging in activity but taking action, typically as the outcome of making a decision (this is why he thinks that, strictly speaking, animals and children do not "take action" even though they are clearly active physically and biologically). Second is that Aristotle contrasts εὐπραξία with εὐτυχία or good fortune; success is a matter of achievement, not luck.</p>
<p>This view of what it means to "do well" was not original with Aristotle but goes back to Socrates. In Book 3, Chapter 9 of his <cite>Memorabilia</cite>, Xenophon recounts a conversation in which someone asked Socrates what is the highest pursuit for a human being, to which Socrates replied: "Success" (εὐπραξία). When further questioned about the relationship between luck and success, Socrates explained that "success is to do something well by dint of learning and practice, and those who make this their pursuit seem to me to do well (εὖ πράττειν)".</p>
<p>Although Aristotle does not define things this way, I'm tempted to say that εὐδαιμονία is a combination of εὐπραξία (success at taking action) and εὐβουλία (success at making decisions). Interestingly, both terms appear more often in the <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite> than in the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>: εὐβουλία is analyzed exclusively in what is traditionally known as NE VI.9, but as Anthony Kenny has shown that is actually EE V.9; and εὐπραξία/εὐπραγία is mentioned six times in the EE but only once in the NE. Whether this has import for the interpretation of the terms at issue (and εὐδαιμονία as a whole) remains to be seen - I plan to complete an in-depth comparison of the two treatises before I publish my forthcoming book <cite>Complete Yourself</cite>. Stay tuned for details...</p>

<h2><a href="1629.html">RFC 8600: XMPP Grid</a></h2>
<h3>2019-06-26</h3>
<p>Sometimes you provide so much feedback on an Internet-Draft that the authors ask you to become a co-author. Such was the case with draft-ietf-mile-xmpp-grid, which defines a method for using XMPP to exchange information about security incidents (e.g., via the IODEF format) on a controlled-access network. The resulting standard (RFC 8600) is a rare example of what the IETF standards process document defines as an "Applicability Statement" (another recent example is RFC 8036). This is the 45th RFC I've authored or co-authored, which shockingly enough is one more than Vint Cerf - not that my contributions to the Internet are nearly as important as his!</p>

<h2><a href="1628.html">Aristotle Research Report #10: σχολή</a></h2>
<h3>2019-05-15</h3>
<p>In <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> X.7, Aristotle mentions almost in passing that "we engage in unleisured pursuits so that we may be at leisure" (1177b5). In <cite>Politics</cite> Book VIII, where he discusses the role of music in human life, he expands on this idea:</p>
<blockquote>Nature itself strives not only to be busy in the right way but also to be capable of being at leisure in a beautiful way. For this one principle governs everything, so let us speak about it again. If one has need of both, but being at leisure is more worthy of choice and more an end than being busy, what needs to be sought out is what one ought to spend one's leisure doing. (1337b28-33)</blockquote>
<p>Aristotle goes on to explore why educators specifically introduced music into the curriculum for young people, concluding that "it is for that part of life one spends in leisure", which is "the way of life suited to free people" (1338a20-25). Thus "music is to be used to enhance the joy of living and a way of life suited to freedom" (1339b4-5).</p>
<p>He makes a similar argument with regard to the love of wisdom (i.e., philosophy) and intellectual work in general: it is serious, inquisitive, self-contained, innately enjoyable, and leisurely.</p>
<p>In her book <cite>Aristotle and the Philosophy of Friendship</cite>, Lorraine Smith Pangle provides a beautiful summary of Aristotle's insights here:</p>
<blockquote>Most of us do not spend much time cultivating activities that are good in themselves and not frivolous, but we do recognize them: music, good conversation, gazing into a lover's eyes, learning and contemplating what we know, a quiet, deep enjoyment of what is beautiful. Most of us are too restless and too lazy to spend much time in such pursuits. We are ourselves not talented or accomplished in the arts, and being a spectator is less satisfying than being actively engaged in them. We find thinking difficult and unpleasant, and we are too agitated to contemplate anything for long. We need problems to tackle and common enemies to fight to give depth to our friendships, exams to take and performances to give to keep us learning and practicing, courses to teach and publication deadlines to keep us thinking. But all of these things are ultimately crutches and should be frankly regarded as such.</blockquote>
<p>As David Roochnik notes in <cite>Retrieving Aristotle in an Age of Crisis</cite>, the Greek word for leisure is, ironically, σχολή - the root of our English words school and scholar. Yet nowadays we find nothing restful about schooling and scholarship. By contrast, although Aristotle was incredibly productive, he held that true learning emerges from a more leisurely approach, driven not by the desire for honors or money or fame but by the sheer love of inquiry and creativity. Naturally, few people have the requisite financial means or psychological makeup to live that way, but more fundamentally it is an ideal that we have almost completely lost touch with. The grievous effects of that loss are all around us.</p>

<h2><a href="1627.html">Tales of Slow Time</a></h2>
<h3>2019-04-28</h3>
<p>I've been thinking about writing a set of linked short stories entitled <cite>Tales of Slow Time</cite>, set in the early 22nd century. As I see it, this will be a time of extremely rapid change and constant flux. Because humans won't be able to absorb change at that rate, they will be even further dumbed down and domesticated compared to today, living as they will in a culture of convenience, pleasure, entertainment, and post-literacy. The influence of raw intelligence will be even more keenly felt (cf. the seven tribes), resulting in extreme inequality. Governments everywhere will have implemented a universal basic income to placate the great mass of people who would otherwise have no livelihood. However, most people will therefore have too much free time: some will use that time to cause trouble, meddle, protest; others will play immersive video games or plug into virtual worlds; others will engage in simulacra of productivity (incubators of nothing). The human population will be both smaller and older. Information technology will be pervasive: robots will perform many routine and non-routine tasks; algorithms will rule the day; people will be subject to ubiquitous tracking, profiling, surveillance, and manipulation through advertising, marketing, nudging, and helpthink; we will experience the gamification of all activities and human/machine interactions; news, information, audio, video, AR/VR, holography - anything presented or represented through networks or computers - will be essentially made up (fiat everything); people will have little certainty about what is real. Everything and everyone will be mapped, tracked, annotated, recorded via the hypermap and the ledger. Robots will be our friends and teachers; machines will perceive our moods; all of our choices will be "suggested" by algorithms. Corporations and governments will engage in lifelong observation and manipulation of each and every individual. There will be no privacy, no autonomy, no serenity, no humanity. We will live in a materially abundant spiritual wasteland ruled by impersonal forces of government, science, technology, corporations, insurers, medicine, politics, even the arts.</p>
<p>But there will be a significant minority of refuseniks, called slowtimers, who will prefer to interact in human ways, unmediated by computers and robots and algorithms. Slowtimers will do things in old-fashioned ways: they will prefer bicycling and walking; engage in farming, gardening, and cooking; cultivate the arts of reading and conversation; pursue careers and hobbies as artists and craftspeople and storytellers and tinkerers; labor in cooperatives and other human-scale organizations; produce live music, plays, dance, readings, and other in-person events that can’t be faked; feel a veneration for what is old (rivers, trees, mountains, temples, festivals, pubs, books, music, wisdom); create structures, establish institutions, and plant things that are designed to last. Slowtimers will persist in all parts of the world and will be variously tolerated, segregated into certain localities, even forced onto reservations. They will exist in shadowy areas on the hypermap where people mostly live off-ledger with no Internet and no computers, communicating in person and by pre-net methods like radio and letter. Slowtimer communities will prize localism and will be largely self-sufficient. Religions and philosophies of various kinds will play a prominent role through contemplation, retreats, churches, prayer, and liturgical time. Although I associate slow time especially with Taoism, slowtimers will cleave to no one creed because there are many varieties of personalism. Slowtimers will seek out deeply active and personal antidotes to impersonalism: callings and creative pursuits, close relationships, learning and inquiry, involvement in community, and the like. They will also seek longevity not through pills and advanced medical technologies (and the intrusive monitoring that big data requires), but by slowing down the experience of life, by living authentically, and by treasuring each moment of existence.</p>
<p>There will be many sources of conflict between the fast world of the future and the slowtimers who live within it. A coordinated array of impersonal forces will make life hard for slowtimers by denying them job opportunities, advanced technologies, insurance, government benefits, medical care, the ability to travel, even the right to equal justice under the law. All too often, slowtimers will be treated as subversives and enemies of the people; in order to survive, they will need to develop alternative economic and political structures based on mutual aid and free association, such as fraternal societies and cooperatives. The physical and emotional borders between fast and slow will be difficult and even dangerous to navigate (how do you transfer wealth from the monitored economy to the free economy? what happens if the child of slowtimer parents wishes to join the fast world? what heartbreak ensues when a fasttimer falls in love with a slowtimer? etc.).</p>
<p>As with any small group, slowtimers will be subject to infighting and schisms, which will be exploited ruthlessly by the authorities. But maybe, just maybe, by thinking eternally and acting presently they will find a way to overcome the forces of impersonalism and build a more human world. They'd better, because they're our only hope.</p>

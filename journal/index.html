<h2><a href="1616.html">Investing in Life</a></h2>
<h3>2018-11-17</h3>
<p>Recently I got to talking with my friend Dave Jilk about happiness, flourishing, and my future book <cite>The Art of Living</cite>. While relating my ideas about the goals of life (as captured in a recent blog post), I described the importance of taking a balanced approach and including all or most of these goals in one's life pursuits. He likened this to portfolio management in investing, which is a great analogy. This spurred me to thinking further about the value that each area of life brings to one's overall success in life. Consider a few somewhat fanciful extensions of this analogy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health and vitality are like cash: a liquid asset you can spend immediately at any time (but if you run out of them, you're bankrupt).</li>
<li>Achievement and projects are like stocks: dependent on great productivity over time.</li>
<li>Love and friendship are like long-term bonds: in fact they literally <em>are</em> bonds of connection you build and maintain with another person.</li>
<li>Wisdom is like gold: a pure, precious, unalloyed value that is never oxidized or corrupted.</li>
<li>Character is like real estate: the underlying ground and home of all the value you create in life.</li>
<li>Beauty is like art: an everlasting value whose experience is at the same time deeply ephemeral.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I mentioned a few years ago, the approach to financial investing I have adopted (the Permanent Portfolio) involve equal weighting of four asset classes: cash, stocks, long-term bonds, and gold. Supposedly, the ultra-rich (who often think of maintaining wealth across generations) typically invest in real estate, gold, and art. Putting these together yields six asset classes, similar to those I'm exploring for investing in life. Although these analogies might be merely suggestive, I find them intriguing nonetheless.</p>

<h2><a href="1615.html">Impasses</a></h2>
<h3>2018-10-30</h3>
<p>Impasses along the path toward the goals of life can occur in three dimensions:</p>
<ol>
<li>From beginning to end: immaturity, getting stuck on earlier phases of life, inability to let go of upbringing issues, unrealistic / fantastical goals for the future, living too much in the past or the future, inability to translate goals into specific plans and practices.</li>
<li>From below to above: materialism, consumerism, hedonism, over focus on preconditions for eudaimonia like health and wealth, guilt over natural needs and drives, (less commonly) otherworldliness.</li>
<li>From without to within: envy and anger and resentment, over concern with how others perceive you (reputation, desire for fame), over acceptance of external standards, submerging your identity in a movement or ideology, self-absorption, lack of friendships, inability to form healthy relationships, lack of self-knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>Along all three dimensions a healthy balance is needed and enables a truly human kind of flourishing.</p>

<h2><a href="1614.html">Goals of Life</a></h2>
<h3>2018-10-30</h3>
<p>There are many ways to categorize and divide up the various areas and activities of life. Here is a six-fold scheme I'm exploring:</p>
<ol>
<li>Health, diet, exercise, etc., focused on the goal of vitality</li>
<li>Family, friendship, marriage, belonging, etc., focused on the goal of love</li>
<li>Work, creating value, finance, security, etc., focused on the goal of achievement</li>
<li>Creativity, art, appreciation, nature, etc., focused on the goal of beauty</li>
<li>Inquiry, learning, understanding, spirituality, etc., focused on the goal of wisdom</li>
<li>Self discipline, self mastery, self improvement, etc., focused on the goal of character</li>
</ol>
<p>In this scheme, life consists of striving for vitality, love, achievement, beauty, wisdom, character. I understand all of these as stable states or ongoing activities, i.e., as ends in themselves. In turn, these goals are fulfilled through projects, relationships, and experiences. The hardest part, as always, is implementation: translating your goals into actionable plans and sustainable practices. Philosophy as a way of life is, then, a matter of making sense of life and guiding your plans and practices by that understanding. (Note: many people make a mess of at least one area of life!)</p>
<p>This is the merest sketch, and will need to be refined and revised based on evidence from psychology, philosophy, happiness studies, etc.</p>

<h2><a href="1613.html">Understanding Others</a></h2>
<h3>2018-10-26</h3>
<p>In my recent philosophy talk, I mentioned that thinking philosophically has helped me better understand people. This might seem counterintuitive - after all, don't big thinkers believe they have all the answers? Yes, I used to have that kind of arrogance, too. Yet over time I started to wonder: why do people have so many different opinions about things? Why have these various philosophies of life persisted for so long (Stoicism, Platonism, Buddhism, Taoism, etc.)? Why do I think what I think? Is it really in my control? At some level can you really "blame" people for the contents of their minds?</p>
<p>And then I started to put myself in the other person's shoes: to them, I'm the crazy one! This opened my mind to trying to understand other people. How does the world look to them? What ideas and premises motivate their statements and actions? What evidence is there for those ideas or what experiences could lead them to believe those things? The more I do this, the more I realize that usually there is evidence and experience behind other people's beliefs. I don't always agree with those beliefs, but at least I can see that there's something valid there. For instance, take the beliefs of someone who is deeply skeptical about business. Well, even arch-capitalist Ayn Rand recognized the reality of the mixed economy. So often, big businesses use big government as a weapon against smaller companies. They use their money and power to intimidate competitors, stifle criticism, curry favor with politicians and regulators, send their lawyers after companies who hire away their employees or develop similar products, etc. Not all companies do this, of course, but it's common enough that skepticism about business isn't without foundation in reality.</p>
<p>Sure, many people take things too far, form an ideology around one insight, don't see other sides to the argument, etc. But that doesn't invalidate the core insight that might drive such a belief in the first place. Thinking this way has made me much more tolerant and understanding of other people, not just on the big questions of philosophy and ideology but on smaller issues of the kind that arise every day in organizations and communities.</p>

<h2><a href="1611.html">Aristotle Research Report #5: Three Forms of the Good</a></h2>
<h3>2018-10-12</h3>
<p>In Book Two, Chapter Three of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>, Aristotle distinguishes three forms of the good: what is pleasurable or enjoyable (τό ἡδύ), what is useful or advantageous (τό συμφέρων), and what is right or beautiful (τό καλόν). In other places in his writings on both ethics and biology, he distinguishes three forms of reaching or desire (ὄρεξις): craving or appetite (ἐπιθυμία), feeling or passion (θυμός), and decision or will (βούλησις). Various interpreters (such as John Cooper in his book <cite>Reason and Emotion</cite>) have attempted to align these two sets of three, whereas other interpreters (such as Giles Pearson in his book <cite>Aristotle on Desire</cite>) have criticized such attempts as forced, misguided, and not supported by the textual evidence. Although I tend to agree with the integrators because I believe Aristotle was a fairly systematic thinker, I think Cooper's connection of θυμός with τό καλόν isn't right. Instead, it seems to me that craving or appetite is for the pleasant or enjoyable, feeling or passion is for the useful or advantageous, and decision or will is for what's right or beautiful.</p>
<p>This line of argument is opposed to both Cooper and Pearson with regard to θυμός and τό συμφέρων, so I'll sketch out my thinking here. First, let's look at the things that one might gain in life, that might be useful, that might lead to advantage. Since these are not the things that are purely pleasurable or enjoyable (especially physical objects of craving like food and drink and sex - although Aristotle says that in an extended sense there is ἐπιθυμία for higher things like learning), nor the things that are right or beautiful (such as personal excellence, knowledge, and virtue), they must be something else. The best candidates seem to be external goods such as wealth, but especially honor, societal position, respect, and reputation (as pointed out by Fortenbaugh in <cite>Aristotle on Emotion</cite> and Konstan in <cite>The Emotions of the Greeks</cite>, at least in classical times the Greeks were very much oriented toward relative status in their communities).</p>
<p>If we look at Aristotle's various lists of the emotions in <cite>De Anima</cite>, <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>, <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite>, and <cite>Rhetoric</cite>, we can see that most of them are, or can be construed as, fundamentally social or comparative: anger or ὀργή is triggered by being slighted or disrespected or attacked (and thus losing something you value or losing face in your community), envy or φθόνος is a desire to have what another person has, jealousy or ζῆλος is a desire that someone else not have what they have, fear or φόβος is a desire not to lose what you have (up to and including your own life), pity or ἕλεος is what you feel when someone undeserving loses what they have, regret or πόθος is what you feel when you have lost something, boldness or θάρσος is assertiveness about seeking advantage, shame or αἰδώς occurs if you lose face, delight or χαρά is what you might feel if you have gained something of great value, love or φιλία is what you feel for something or someone you want to gain (note that there are dozens of Greek words beginning with φιλο- such as φιλοθηρία for love of hunting or φιλοκυδής for love of glory), hatred or μῖσος is what you feel for something or someone that threatens you or what you have, etc. These emotions could all be varieties of θυμός or at least could arise in what Aristotle calls the θυμοειδής (the seat of or capacity for θυμός); although Aristotle never comes out and says that directly about all of these feelings, he says that about enough of them (e.g., ὀργή, φόβος, φιλία) that I think we can generalize.</p>
<p>For Aristotle, the conscious resolve to pursue what's right is distinctively human, whereas we share cravings for what's pleasurable and feelings for what's advantageous with other animals (ἐπιθυμία and θυμός are non-rational, whereas βούλησις is rational). Yet human beings are not disembodied minds: thus the best form of living is to integrate all three forms of the good by finding the highest pleasure and truest advantage in activities and practices for the sake of τό καλόν; the result is a seamless combination of right reason (ὀρθός λόγος) and right reaching (ὀρθός ὄρεξις). I'll have more to say about that in my forthcoming book on Aristotle.</p>

<h2><a href="1634.html">Aristotle Research Report #13: Phase One Complete</a></h2>
<h3>2019-12-26</h3>
<p>Yesterday I finished phase one of my research into Aristotle's ethics, in preparation for writing <cite>Complete Yourself: Aristotle on Personal Excellence</cite>. As I described in a blog post over five years ago, for me the process of "working through" a thinker initially involves absorbing all of his or her writings, supplemented by some of the secondary literature. Since I started this project about two years ago, I've read everything by Aristotle and Plato, as well as numerous scholarly books on Aristotle, totalling around 120 distinct works. To give you a sense of the magnitude, here's a photo of the relevant books in my own collection (not counting all the ones I've checked out of libraries throughout Colorado and Wyoming, thanks to the wonders of Prospector, our regional inter-library loan system):</p>
<p><img src="/images/aristotle-1.jpg"></p>
<p>That's a lot of reading! The next phase will be even more intense: re-reading all of the passages I've marked up, identifying the core themes I want to explore, and coming to conclusions regarding Aristotle's answers to fundamental questions about how to live a good human life. Because there is so much deep material to cover, I expect that this next phase will consume most of my free time in 2020. All this so that I can summarize Aristotle's philosophy of life in 100 pages or less, as to date I've also done with Rand, Nietzsche, Thoreau, and Epicurus in the "eudaimonia suite" that comprises my lifelong philosophy project.</p>

<h2><a href="1633.html">Aristotle Research Report #12: A Eudemian Thread</a></h2>
<h3>2019-12-08</h3>
<p>At the very end of Aristotle's <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite> there is a puzzling passage about the standard (ὅρος) according to which the "good and beautifully right" person (καλοκαγαθός) makes choices with regard to natural goods such as wealth, health, strength, honor, power, good fortune, and personal relationships. Surprisingly, he says that whatever conduces to the cultivation (θεραπεία) and awareness (θεωρία) of god is best and is the most beautifully right standard, whereas anything that hinders such cultivation and awareness is unworthy, trifling, and bad (φαῦλος - the opposite of what is σπουδαῖος, i.e. worthy, serious, and good). Until these last few paragraphs, nothing in the <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite> had obviously pointed in this startlingly "theological" direction or had advocated a godlike, superhuman existence; yet if we pay careful attention to the text, we can patiently unravel a thread of inquiry that elucidates Aristotle's last word on the topic of the best human life.</p>
<p>Working our way backward from end to beginning, let's first look at these things that are good by nature, such as wealth and power and good reputation. The ancient Greeks were distrustful of such things because although they are good by nature, they also have no natural limit. How much wealth or power or good reputation is too much? Although one needs some wealth in order to live, a person can all too easily be corrupted through the avaricious pursuit of extreme wealth (or great power or high status). Is there some way to set a <em>human</em> limit on things that have no <em>natural</em> limit?</p>
<p>Here Aristotle's conception of the divine can help us. Aristotle was very far from believing in Zeus and Apollo and all the other traditional gods of Greek society (recall that near the end of his life he fled Athens after being charged with impiety - essentially, atheism). Aristotle's god, such as it is, is essentially the pure activity (ἐνέργεια) of awareness (θεωρία). As Aryeh Kosman explains in <cite>The Activity of Being</cite>, because the primary mode of being is ἐνέργεια, the activity of θεωρία (no matter what living thing exhibits it) is more fundamental than the contemplation of some pre-existing divinity or god. Beings are divine to the extent that they engage in the activity of awareness. Thus the highest and best being would, as a kind of limit case, be the one that is self-contained, independent, unchanging, well-ordered, fully aware, and fully engaged in the activity of awareness. Thus human beings are best to the extent that partake in these same qualities (indeed, we form our ideas of the divine from our experience of what is best in human life).</p>
<p>There are, therefore, at least several reasons why this human limit-setting on the unbounded pursuit of natural goods might involve the cultivation and emulation of what is divine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because god is self-contained, one might set such limits through continual self-improvement, which is a matter of focusing on internal goods of character and thus seeking the opposite of unbounded desire for things outside yourself. By cultivating such self-improvement, you emulate the highest and best being.</li>
<li>Setting limits on the pursuit of the natural goods involves the cultivation of a life that is wisely ordered by an over-arching goal of excellence (EE I.2); god, too, is well-ordered, whereas the foolishness of unbounded desire leads to internal disorder.</li>
<li>Closely related, harmony and serenity are qualities of what is unchanging, and the excellent human being experiences a harmony between the wise, rational part of the soul that shapes a goal for life and the part that listens to reason; such a person experiences serenity because their actions and feelings are consistent and because the "second nature" of their character is aligned with the "first nature" of the human capacity for living well.</li>
<li>As Aristotle explores at length in books II and III of the <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite>, action for the sake of what's beautifully right (καλός) is more godlike than action for the sake of gain (e.g., the pursuit of wealth) or pleasure (e.g., eros without love of character).</li>
<li>Temperate action is what the law enjoins (EE IV), but listening to external law is only the first step toward listening to your own reason; the gods themselves are supremely independent in this way because they don't need laws in the first place.</li>
<li>Although an individual human being is not unchanging and eternal, the human species is; thus limiting your desires for external goods could involve maintaining awareness (θεωρία) of your species nature.</li>
<li>God is pure ἐνέργεια, but living well (εὐδαιμονία) is also a kind of divine activity (EE I.3); by setting human limits on unbounded desire for natural goods, one lives well.</li>
<li>The lover of wisdom both seeks to understand why things are the way they are (through σοφία, which is a conceptual grasp of the first causes and ultimate sources of existence - opposed to ignorance on the one hand and sophistry on the other) and aims at actionable truth (through φρόνησις, which reliably knows how to act and feel in a way that's beautifully right and admirably appropriate - opposed to foolishness on the one hand and cunning on the other). Aristotle calls the desire to understand why things are the way they are either primary philosophy (the love of wisdom) or theology. This involves a reverent attitude toward reality, even in the study of natural science (quoting Heraclitus, at the start of the <cite>Parts of Animals</cite> Aristotle notes that "there are gods here too"); without that reverent attitude, one lapses into ignorance or sophistry. And unbounded desire for external goods involves either ignorance (in the form of an animal existence) or sophistry (in the form of self-deception), whereas the person who develops their human potential engages in a kind of divine activity because, as Heraclitus said, one's character is one's guiding spirit or daimon.</li>
<li>There is a close relationship between right action and full awareness. Aristotle hints at this in EE VI during his explanation of weakness of the will or self-indulgence (ἀκρασία). Even if you know how to act and feel in a way that's beautifully right and admirably appropriate (καλός), you won't act aright unless you intentionally apply that knowledge; this involves having the perceptual insight (νοῦς) that your current situation calls for applying that knowledge, and then staying actively aware of (θεωροῦντα) that knowledge in the situation (recall that a divine being is pure awareness). The person of self-indulgence thus does the wrong thing; whereas the person of self-control (ἐγκράτεια) does the right thing but still feels the wrong impulses. The akratic person and the enkratic person both know what is καλός, but though lack of awareness (θεωρία) they don’t see it all the way through in action and feeling.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rough notes point in several directions for further research (e.g., a full elucidation of θεωρία, σοφία, and φρόνησις), but they at least indicate that the conclusion of the <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite> is not as completely unexpected or overtly theological as it might seem as first.</p>

<h2><a href="1632.html">Cooperative Thinking</a></h2>
<h3>2019-08-16</h3>
<p>A few years ago I did a bunch of research and thinking about alternative forms of organizational structure, focused especially on cooperatives (at the time I was thinking about setting up a co-op to run the Jabber.org messaging service). The approach I found most interesting was funding a co-op through something called a direct public offering. This can be done for much less money and with much greater control than VC funding or angel investing or whatever - it's basically a kind of more advanced crowdfunding. Companies that have done this include My Trail (an outdoor clothing company in Boulder, Colorado), Real Pickles (a food co-op in Massachusetts), and Equal Exchange (the original fair trade coffee company, also located in Massachusetts). Other co-ops I investigated are self-funded and haven't pursued the DPO route (e.g., Namasté Solar, Plausible Labs, and Isthmus Engineering)</p>
<p>My conclusion at the time was that it would be best to start out by self-financing the co-op - either alone or with a few partners who also put in sweat equity (i.e., a workers' cooperative) - and then pursue a DPO once you have a going concern. If I recall correctly, this might even be required depending on the state you're in. DPOs are regulated at the state level, which is how they avoid the expense of SEC compliance, but this also means that you can only solicit investors in that state. For example, MyTrail solicited investors only in Colorado. However, it's good to know that Colorado has something of a model legal structure for cooperatives.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I'll ever do anything with the information I gathered, but a few folks have asked me about it over the years so I figured I'd at least make it available here for posterity.</p>

<h2><a href="1631.html">Hummus Recipe</a></h2>
<h3>2019-07-21</h3>
<p>One of my favorite things to eat in the summer (and in truth all year round) is hummus. Because multiple people have requested my recipe over the years, I figured I'd share it here.</p>
<p>Here are the ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>15 oz garbanzo beans</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>pinch cayenne</li>
<li>2 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
<li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
<li>1/4 cup tahini</li>
<li>1/8 cup water</li>
</ul>
<p>Place all ingredients in a food processor and process for 10-15 seconds. That's it!</p>
<p>I like my hummus thick, garlicky, and chunky - if your preferences differ, increase the water, cut back on the garlic, and increase the processing time.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h2><a href="1630.html">Aristotle Research Report #11: εὐπραξία</a></h2>
<h3>2019-07-07</h3>
<p>One of the lesser-known terms in Aristotle's ethical treatises is εὐπραξία (eupraxia) along with its sister εὐπραγία (eupragia). Both terms mean doing well, faring well, having success. Aristotle's use is connected to εὐδαιμονία, which he defines as "living well and doing well" (τὸ εὖ ζῆν καὶ τὸ εὖ πράττειν). But what are the metrics for "success" here? He leaves us several clues. First is the verb πράττειν, which for Aristotle means not merely engaging in activity but taking action, typically as the outcome of making a decision (this is why he thinks that, strictly speaking, animals and children do not "take action" even though they are clearly active physically and biologically). Second is that Aristotle contrasts εὐπραξία with εὐτυχία or good fortune; success is a matter of achievement, not luck.</p>
<p>This view of what it means to "do well" was not original with Aristotle but goes back to Socrates. In Book 3, Chapter 9 of his <cite>Memorabilia</cite>, Xenophon recounts a conversation in which someone asked Socrates what is the highest pursuit for a human being, to which Socrates replied: "Success" (εὐπραξία). When further questioned about the relationship between luck and success, Socrates explained that "success is to do something well by dint of learning and practice, and those who make this their pursuit seem to me to do well (εὖ πράττειν)".</p>
<p>Although Aristotle does not define things this way, I'm tempted to say that εὐδαιμονία is a combination of εὐπραξία (success at taking action) and εὐβουλία (success at making decisions). Interestingly, both terms appear more often in the <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite> than in the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>: εὐβουλία is analyzed exclusively in what is traditionally known as NE VI.9, but as Anthony Kenny has shown that is actually EE V.9; and εὐπραξία/εὐπραγία is mentioned six times in the EE but only once in the NE. Whether this has import for the interpretation of the terms at issue (and εὐδαιμονία as a whole) remains to be seen - I plan to complete an in-depth comparison of the two treatises before I publish my forthcoming book <cite>Complete Yourself</cite>. Stay tuned for details...</p>

<h2><a href="1656.html">Who Was Aristotle?</a></h2>
<h3>2020-11-24</h3>
<p>Greatness is out of fashion these days -- even suspect because of its seeming elitism. Yet it is an inconvenient truth that talents, opportunities, efforts, and achievements vary greatly. In every field of human endeavor there are only a few people who are remembered even 50 years after their passing; multiply 50 by 50 and we reach 2500 years, nearly the upper limit of recorded history, whose rolls are inhabited by a minuscule percentage of those who have ever lived. Even fewer of those remembered are anything but a name, whose works and deeds are still widely studied to this day. At the very pinnacle of these is Aristotle, whose concepts and insights form the foundation of much of human knowledge, science, art, culture, and society.</p>
<p>But who was Aristotle? He was, of course, no more a disembodied mind than any other human being. He had parents (who died when he was a child), an older sister and a younger brother, a wife (who also died young) by whom he had a daughter, another partner after his wife died by whom he had a son, friends, enemies, teachers, schoolmates, colleagues, students, servants, and some very powerful people whom he served and befriended as well. Although the facts of his life are hazy indeed 2400 years later, if the reconstructions of Carlo Natali and especially Anton-Hermann Chroust are close to the mark then he lived quite an eventful life, not just of scholarship but of political influence and something approaching intrigue.</p>
<p>Aristotle was born in 384 BC at a town in northern Greece (almost in Macedonia) called Stagira, a colony founded earlier by the cities of Chalkis and Andros. On both his father's side and his mother's side he was said to be descended from Asclepius, a physician mentioned in <cite>The Iliad</cite> of Homer. His father's family came from Andros and his mother's from Chalkis. His mother Phaestis was apparently from a well-to-do family of Chalkis, where they owned an estate. His father Nicomachus was the court physician to and perhaps a friend and confidant of Amyntas III, the king of Macedonia.</p>
<p>Amyntas died in 370 BC when Aristotle was 14 and Aristotle's parents died before Aristotle went to Athens in 367 BC, so it's possible that Nicomachus and Phaestis were killed during the royal intrigues that followed the death of Amyntas and before the ascension of King Philip II in 359 BC. Aristotle's older sister Arimineste married a man (seemingly a distant relative) named Proxenus and was then put under their care and guidance, it appears across the Aegean Sea at Atarneus on the western coast of Asia Minor. At age 16 or 17 Aristotle went to Athens for further education, perhaps initially with the rhetorician and philosopher Isocrates and then with Plato once the latter returned from an ill-fated venture in Syracuse in southern Italy. Aristotle spent the next 20 years as an active member of the Academy, Plato's school and research community, where he studied and eventually taught.</p>
<p>In 348 or 347 BC, Aristotle left the Academy under circumstances that are unclear. Some accounts say that he left after the death of Plato in 347 BC, but others say that he left in 348 BC before Plato died. Why would he have left sooner? Chroust speculates that Aristotle, with his Macedonian connections, was forced to leave because of anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens stirred up by the fall of Olynthus to the forces of King Philip in the summer of 348 BC. Aristotle went not to Chalkis on the island of Euboea (which was in a state of chaos at the time) but to Atarneus. Here he became a friend and adviser to Hermias, the ruler of Atarneus. While in Atarneus he met and married a woman named Pythia, the daughter or niece of Hermias, with whom he had a daughter also named Pythia.</p>
<p>Scholars of a philosophical bent think that Aristotle went to Atarneus (and then nearby Assos and Mytilene) to study biology. He certainly did study there, but Chroust argues that Aristotle was also engaged in diplomatic missions from King Philip to Hermias, since Atarneus would have provided a beachhead for Philip's planned invasion of Persia. Perhaps the Persian king Artaxerxes I got wind of such machinations, because he had Hermias captured and assassinated in 342 BC.</p>
<p>By then Aristotle might have relocated to Macedonia (Herpyllis, his common-law wife after the death of Pythia and the mother of his son Nicomachus, was from Stagira). Legend has it that Philip called upon Aristotle to tutor his son Alexander (the future Alexander the Great), although there is no early evidence for this relationship (indeed, the Epicureans and Stoics would have loved to pin Alexander's character failings on his teacher Aristotle, but they never mentioned it among their many calumnies). Philip himself was assassinated in 336 BC, whereupon the young Alexander ascended to the throne and proceeded to conquer all of Greece. Amongst the ensuing squabbles, it's possible that Aristotle convinced Alexander to spare the city of Athens, which had revolted along with Thebes (which Alexander destroyed) when rumors spread that Alexander had been killed in fighting the Illyrians. Perhaps not coincidentally, Aristotle returned to Athens in 335 BC, where he founded his own school (the Lyceum) and spent the next thirteen years while Alexander went off to conquer Asia.</p>
<p>During Alexander's prolonged absence, he put one of Philip's old generals, Antipater, in charge of keeping the peace back in Greece. It seems that Aristotle and Antipater had a close relationship (indeed, Antipater was the executor for Aristotle's last will and testament) and they exchanged many letters (which might have included reports from Aristotle on the political situation in Athens). When Alexander died at Babylon in 323 BC, Aristotle once again fled Athens because of anti-Macedonian agitation, which this time took the form of a charge of impiety against Aristotle (the same charge which had led to the execution of Socrates in 399 BC). To prevent the Athenians from "sinning twice against philosophy", Aristotle fled to the estate of his mother's family in Chalkis, where he died soon after in 322 BC at the age of 62, perhaps of stomach cancer.</p>
<p>Thus we can see that Aristotle led a full and eventful life. In the midst of all this, Aristotle founded the sciences of logic and biology, wrote hundreds of popular and scholarly works on an enormous range of subjects, taught numerous students, and contributed fundamentally to epistemology, metaphysics, psychology, rhetoric, literary analysis, political theory, and ethics. Although he was not without a few faults, his intellectual legacy is immense and will never be equalled.</p>
<p>What was Aristotle like as a person? That's hard to say. Unlike Socrates, he never served in the military and never had to work for a living, although as we've seen the ancient sources indicate that he was quite active in diplomatic affairs. Unlike Plato, Epicurus, and many other ancient (and modern) philosophers, Aristotle married and had children, to whom he was very devoted (as witness the great care he expended in his will to ensure that his deceased relations would be remembered and that his living relations would be cared for). Also in his will he made provisions to free the slaves he inherited with generous stipends so that they could support themselves. He seems to have been a steadfast friend to powerful men like Philip, Hermias, and Antipater as well as to colleagues in learning like Theophrastus and Xenocrates. Clearly he worked extremely hard to understand the world around him; but he also, through his popular writings and his teaching, put a great deal of thought and effort into convincing other people (especially rich young aristocrats) to take life seriously through philosophical exploration instead of, say, military expeditions or the pursuit of mindless pleasures.</p>
<p>Socrates said that the unexamined life is not worth living; Aristotle examined <em>everything</em> so deeply that we could say his life was more worth living than that of anyone else in human history. That, my friends, is greatness.</p>

<h2><a href="1655.html">It Was Twenty Years Ago Today</a></h2>
<h3>2020-11-21</h3>
<p>On November 21st, 2000, I posted the first entry in this online journal. Although I had tried my hand at writing a weblog even before then (e.g., using a tool for posting entries through a Jabber messaging app), writing at my own website was more appealing. Given that I'm still posting here twenty years later, I declare my original experiment a success. Here's how I characterized this space in that first entry:</p>
<blockquote>I see this space as part diary, part sandbox, and part weblog -- a place to explore ideas and events on the web, in real life, and in my head.</blockquote>
<p>That's still very much the case. Although the topics I explore aren't quite the same (for instance, I rarely post about technology or politics any longer) and although my perspectives aren't quite the same, I perceive more continuity than change in the 1655 entries I've posted so far.</p>
<p>Here's to the next twenty years!</p>

<h2><a href="1654.html">Aristotle's Dialectical Pedagogy: A Review of Revaluing Ethics by Thomas W. Smith</a></h2>
<h3>2020-11-12</h3>
<p>In my research toward writing <cite>Complete Yourself: Aristotle on Human Fulfillment</cite>, I have read dozens and dozens of books about Aristotle's ethics and his philosophy in general. A small number of those books stand out in the crowded field of Aristotelian studies, but only one of them has been a revelation to me: <cite>Revaluing Ethics: Aristotle's Dialectical Pedagogy</cite> by Thomas W. Smith.</p>
<p>Smith uncovers and elucidates the conceptual and (dare I say) literary flow of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> by revealing how Aristotle leads his likely audience of young, virile, aristocratic young men from unquestioning adherence to conventional values toward a radical questioning and revaluing of everything they thought they knew was true and right (that is: toward the examined life). We are not accustomed to treating an Aristotelian treatise like the <cite>Ethics</cite> as a work of literature, but Smith demonstrates convincingly that this is the exactly right way to treat it (in the process showing that it's not a traditional treatise at all, but a living, breathing exploration of the foundations of human life). He upends so many of the assumptions of academic scholarship regarding Aristotle (from the so-called Doctrine of the Mean to the so-called great-souled man, from the relation between justice and equity to the meaning and role of love in human life, from the bifurcation between moral virtue and intellectual virtue to the desire to understand the world around us through contemplation) that by the end of his book my head was spinning.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the new vistas he opens up are tremendously exciting. Can we apply his dialetical methodology to, say, the <cite>Politics</cite> or the <cite>Metaphysics</cite>? Would a similar analysis of the <cite>Eudemian Ethics</cite> yield complementary fruit? If so much that we thought we knew about Aristotle's ethics simply isn't true, what are Aristotle's deepest insights into living a successful human life? If Aristotle were presented with an audience of present-day Westerners, how would he lead <em>them</em> toward the examined life and what assumptions would he drive them to question along the way? These are fascinating questions, which I hope to explore as I continue to dig deeper and deeper into Aristotle's philosophy.</p>

<h2><a href="1653.html">Election Survival Guide</a></h2>
<h3>2020-11-01</h3>
<p>Every four years I dread the prospect of yet another election for president of the United States. What a depressing, anxiety-ridden spectacle! It's almost enough to make me a monarchist (if only we could find the right sort of monarch, of course).</p>
<p>As with everything else, 2020 is worse than usual. With every election season that passes, it appears that Americans of the partisan variety become even more tribalistic in their beliefs and emotions. Their attitude seems to be that above all we must keep those other bastards from gaining power because they're either closet fascists or closet communists. Those of us in the moderate middle (if you can call a libertarian gradualist like me a moderate) are caught in the crossfire uttering curses of "a plague on both your houses!"</p>
<p>In the spirit of Rudyard Kipling's advice to "keep your head when all about you are losing theirs", here are a few suggestions for making it through the impending election of 2020:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Recognize Reality.</strong> Have you ever noticed that no matter who is elected president, the core functions and dysfunctions of American governance remain pretty much the same? Democrat or Republican, we still have 47 ineffective federal jobs programs, a broken system of legal immigration, endless farm subsidies, an unaccountable FISA court, an inscrutable tax code, tragically awful schools in the inner cities, a continually growing budget deficit, and so on ad infinitum. Just a thought: perhaps it really doesn't make that much of a difference who's elected.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Concentrate on Continuity.</strong> Yes, the potential outcomes can seem bad, especially if you lean far in one direction or the other. Yet a corollary to the first point is that there is more continuity than change in American governance: we've had representative assemblies, trial by jury, and (mostly) the rule of law for 400 years. It's unlikely that we'll experience a radical break in these traditions at every level of government overnight (do you think that your city council or county courts will simply disappear?).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exit the Whirlwind.</strong> The outcome of all but the most local of elections is completely outside your span of control and influence. Why fret about something you can't change? Indeed, why deliberately subject yourself to extra fretting by paying attention to the partisan vitriol and useless chatter on TV, radio, and the Internet? Just let it go. In any case, you'll have to deal with whatever the consequences are, so it's better to stay mentally sharp and practically flexible if you want to thrive under the new regime.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Heal Thyself.</strong> Politics is a disease from which only you can cure yourself. Just about everything in life (family, friends, health, community, work, love, art, science, culture, environment, philosophy, religion) is far more important than politics. By taking action in these domains, you'll experience much more fulfillment and you'll do something positive for the state of the world. Politics is almost always the problem; it's far superior to be part of the solution.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, elections happen. I wish you the best of luck in surviving this one!</p>

<h2><a href="1652.html">A Wider Palette</a></h2>
<h3>2020-10-30</h3>
<p>In my most recent post ("Beyond Binary"), I talked about the need to transcend dichotomies and false alternatives. One aspect of doing so is recognizing what I called a wider palette of viewpoints, which is easy to do in philosophy and psychology but not in politics (at least not in American politics with its two-party system).</p>
<p>Continuing my focus on the personal rather than the political, I'd like to explore another domain of human experience that is rightly home to a wider palette: the inner life of feelings and emotions.</p>
<p>Too many people have a kind of binary view of human feelings. For instance, we might think that one dimension of emotional experience is being either satisfied or angry. If these are the only alternatives along this dimension, then it's all too easy to quickly escalate to an extremely angry reaction toward people or events you encounter.</p>
<p>A wider palette enables you to identify and experience a wider and likely healthier range of reactions. Perhaps you're not truly angry (let alone irate, outraged, or furious) but merely annoyed, disappointed, irritated, miffed, vexed, frustrated, irked, or displeased. Or, on the positive side of the spectrum, perhaps you're not merely satisfied but pleased, content, happy, delighted, elated, ecstatic, overjoyed, or euphoric.</p>
<p>One practice I've found helpful in this regard is searching for just the right word to describe what I'm feeling. To do so, I might consult one of my favorite books: the thesaurus. Or I might try to identify how a character in a novel I've read might have felt in a particular situation. This practice can be applied even more broadly to, say, pieces of music (is the emotional tenor of Chopin's Polonaise #6 best captured by "heroic", "triumphant", "jubilant", or "exultant"?). An added benefit is that taking a moment to identify what I'm feeling can give me just enough distance to not react immediately in a way that I might regret later.</p> 
<p>Give it a try and let me know how it goes for you!</p>

<h3>2020-09-20</h3>
<p>As political polarization proliferates, it's beneficial to explore realms of thought that are not limited to left vs. right and us vs. them. Personally, I'm partial to philosophy: it's impossible to reduce all of philosophical thinking to, say, Epicureans vs. Stoics without ignoring the deep and unique contributions of Platonists, Aristotelians, Taoists, Buddhists, Confucians, Hindus, Christians, humanists, skeptics, existentialists, and many more.</p>
<p>Matters are similar in psychology, populated as it is by Freudians, Jungians, Adlerians, behaviorists, cognitivists, humanists, and adherents of more recent trends like evolutionary psychology and positive psychology.</p>
<p>Or consider music, with its many genres, sub-genres, and practitioners. Even in, say, jazz music you can experience ragtime, dixieland, stride, swing, bebop, hard bop, free jazz, chamber jazz, Latin jazz, gypsy jazz, bossa nova, and many more. The landscape is similar in literature, film, painting, sculpture, and other art-forms.</p>
<p>Yet in the world of politics - especially American politics with its two-party system - we are experiencing what Lee Drutman recently identified as a partisan death spiral. Although his recommended remedies are worth trying, I'd like to suggest something even deeper: ignore politics and immerse yourself in human phenomena that aren't merely two-sided. Philosophy, psychology, and the arts are fine places to start, especially because each one has its own kind of healing powers and yields its own kind of wisdom. Perhaps if we all became more attuned to finer shades of difference in these domains we'd be less likely to tolerate polarization in politics, too. Or so we can hope.</p>

<h2><a href="1609.html">Foundations for Philosophical Practice</a></h2>
<h3>2018-09-24</h3>
<p>Recently I've revisited a field that's intrigued me for some time: philosophical counselling, or more broadly philosophical practice. Most of those active in this field are almost anti-method, and what methods they do employ are derived from hermeneutics, phenomenology, existentialism, Stoicism, and Socratic questioning - some of which I find interesting but none of which I find deeply congenial. Philosophical practice emerged in Europe around 1980 among thinkers influenced by hermeneutics and existentialism, and even the American philosophers in this area are mostly existentialists (associated with the American Philosophical Practitioners Association) or Stoics (associated with the National Philosophical Counseling Association) - for instance, Elliot Cohen, the progenitor of logic-based therapy, was a disciple of Albert Ellis (inventor of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy). By contrast, my philosophical orientation is toward eudaimonia (the ancient Greek term for happiness, flourishing, living well) and the focus of my writing and living is on solving problems that hinder the pursuit of happiness. Upon reflection, I'm starting to see the possibility of developing a more joyous approach to philosophical practice that takes its inspiration from positive thinkers - especially the six I'm writing books about: Rand, Nietzsche, Aristotle, Thoreau, Epicurus, and Lao Tzu.</p>
<p>Thus while I read deeply in Aristotle for my forthcoming book <cite>Complete Yourself</cite>, I'm pondering how to apply a more Aristotelian methodology to philosophical practice. In many of Aristotle's books, he starts with what he calls aporia - perplexity, getting stuck, reaching an impasse. Plato's early Socratic dialogues all end in aporia but never "break on through to the other side" of solving the problem. Aristotle goes beyond Socrates using a methodology of asking questions, describing prior opinions and theories, analyzing alternative explanations, and synthesizing his findings. Perhaps a similar methodology can be applied to solving the problems of life, too. Consider the following cycle:</p>
<ol>
<li>You hit an aporia, feel perplexity, get stuck, reach an impasse - this is what drives you to seek counsel in the first place (whether your own or that of a wise person).</li>
<li>You and your counselor formulate the right questions - i.e., questions the answers to which might enable you to break through the impasse.</li>
<li>You gather information (which includes evidence from your own experience) and come to understand philosophical theories that could help answer the questions.</li>
<li>You sift through and analyze the information and theories to draw distinctions, eliminate paradoxes, harmonize accounts, find explanations, and gain insight.</li>
<li>You synthesize what you have learned in the form of a new or modified worldview that is more true to your experience, nature, and goals.</li>
<li>You use this worldview to inform your plans and guide your practice of life in ways that lead to greater eudaimonia.</li>
</ol>
<p>Eventually you might reach another impasse, sending you back to the first step (however, if you've been guided through the process before, this time you might be able to serve as your own counselor instead of working with someone else).</p>
<p>This is the merest sketch of a method that might serve as an Aristotelian foundation for philosophical practice. Naturally I need to think about it, research it, and try it out before I consider it valid. But I feel it has some promise.</p>

<h2><a href="1608.html">Perspectives on the Path</a></h2>
<h3>2018-09-05</h3>
<p>An essential lesson of philosophy is the ancient Greek formula "know yourself". It sounds easy, but it's immensely difficult. One model of self-knowledge I'm exploring is to look at your path in life from six different perspectives: beginning, end, above, below, side, within.</p>
<ol>
<li>Beginning: Understanding your innate personality and your earliest hopes and sense of self; this involves both working with your personality and at times attempting to mitigate it (you can't really change it!).</li>
<li>End: How you want to feel about your life on your deathbed - your accomplishments, the character you built, the knowledge and wisdom you gained, the value you created, the relationships you nurtured, the impact you had in the world.</li>
<li>Below: Accepting yourself as also an animal with physical needs, drives, and desires; this includes perspectives from evolutionary psychology, your physiological uniqueness, the lower levels of Maslow's hierarchy (such as security), etc.</li>
<li>Above: Looking at your life from the perspective of eternity or at least of your ideals; are you living up to what's highest and best and even divine in yourself and in human nature? Thinkers as varied as Aristotle, Spinoza, Thoreau, and Nietzsche provide some guideposts here.</li>
<li>Side: Mentally and emotionally stepping aside from your path and seeing yourself as others might or in a more detached way, as can be learned from the Taoist practice of wu-wei. Friendship, love, and counseling can assist in this work because other people naturally have the kind of detachment that you can't easily attain.</li>
<li>Within: The internal experience of traveling along your path (are you on the right track or satisfied with how your life is going?), and of creating meaning as you move through your environment (similar to J.J. Gibson's concept of affordances in visual perception).</li>
</ol>
<p>Although this model makes intuitive sense to me, I have not yet had the time to flesh it out, connect it fully to psychology and philosophy, or define the various practices involved in applying it to the pursuits of happiness and wisdom. I plan to do that over the next few years.</p>

<h2><a href="1607.html">Intensive Reading</a></h2>
<h3>2018-07-23</h3>
<p>As previously mentioned, I have in mind to write a novel about the ancient Greek philosopher Pyrrho and his journey to central Asia and northwestern India with the army of Alexander the Great. As part of my research I'm reading a great deal of philosophy, history, and fiction. It's been fascinating to return to the reading of fiction after a lapse of many years - I feel like I have fresh eyes for everything. My readings in the genre of philosophical fiction have ranged all over the map - during a business trip last week I devoured <cite>The Name of the Rose</cite> by Umberto Eco, before that I re-read <cite>The Left Hand of Darkness</cite> by Ursula K. Le Guin, and I'm currently reading both <cite>The Picture of Dorian Gray</cite> by Oscar Wilde and <cite>The Awakening</cite> by Kate Chopin. Alongside these works of fiction I'm reading books of philosophical scholarship (the latest were a full-length study of Pyrrho and an exploration of epistemology after Protagoras) and I'm starting to explore the historical background to the massive cultural change from classical to hellenistic Greece. Umberto Eco's book in particular has given me a new ambition of combining the story of Pyrrho's intellectual development with a mystery novel about the still unexplained death of Alexander the Great! It turns out the Pyrrho was probably not quite the radical skeptic he's usually taken to be (although he did believe that the entities we encounter in reality are indefinite and thus hard to pin down in many ways). Combine this with political intrigue on an imperial scale and perhaps regicide (indeed, there's an ancient legend that Aristotle himself was somehow involved in the assassination of his former pupil Alexander, perhaps in revenge for Alexander's execution of Aristotle's nephew Kallisthenes), and we might have the makings of large-scale novel that hinges in part on the validity of the law of non-contradiction! This is all quite speculative at this point because I have over 200 more books to read during the research phase, and I would also need to intensively study how the better authors construct their novels (an art of which I am mostly ignorant). Although I'm not sure if I have a book this big in me, I'm enjoying the exploration of possibilities. And all this reading has kept me from blogging, thus my absence here. Hopefully the results will be worth waiting for...</p>

<h2><a href="1606.html">Notes Toward an Aristotelian Philosophy of Music</a></h2>
<h3>2018-04-13</h3>
<p>In Book VIII of his <cite>Politics</cite>, Aristotle talks about music: its role in ancient Greek education, its differences from the other arts, and its philosophical significance. This is not an in-depth exploration of the philosophy of music (what I wouldn't give for his lost work <cite>Ρερὶ Μουσικῆς</cite>), but more of a cursory glance. Yet through extrapolation we can tease out some meaning from his discussion.</p>
<p>Aristotle wonders why the ancients had legislated music (along with language and physical exercise) as one of the three primary areas of study for Greek youth, given that it is not especially useful (in the sense that physical exercise conduces to courage, or knowledge of the Greek language helps one succeed in community interactions). He notes that music is not merely pleasant but that it is one of the highest forms of leisure - a fitting adornment to the life of a free people. Yet this is not enough, for he also wonders whether music has some ethical purpose by prodding one to become a better person.</p>
<p>He concludes that this is indeed the case, for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Music as free play bears a likeness (ὁμοιώμα) to the purpose or goal (τέλος) at which one's more weighty actions aim, i.e., at εὐδαιμονία or living well.</li>
<li>This likeness extends more deeply, because the rhythms and melodies and harmonies of music themselves bear a likeness to excellent states of character such as courage, self-control, mildness, or justified anger (at one point he even says that they are not just likenesses but representations or μιμήματα, whereas in the visual arts one finds only signs or indications or excellent states of character).</li>
<li>Making good judgments about a likeness accustoms one to making good judgments about the things to which it bears a likeness; thus learning to make and appreciate music accustoms one to making good judgments about how best to live.</li>
</ol>
<p>What Aristotle does not elucidate is the exact nature of the likeness. However, based on our knowledge of his writings on ethics and psychology we can make some informed guesses. In <cite>De Anima</cite>, Aristotle describes ψυχή or aliveness (usually translated "soul") as what gives overall form to the body, and in the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> he describes each ἀρετή (thriving or excellence of character) as a deliberate practice of good judgment, reasoned choice, and planned activity resulting in a balance between extremes in a particular domain of human life. Just as ψυχή is the form or guiding force of the body, so ἦθος or character is the forming, directing, guiding influence over your bodily motions and emotions, your actions and reactions. In a similar way, perhaps rhythms and melodies and harmonies impose an order or balance on the emotional expressions of music by forming and shaping them in a way that is mindfully attuned to a certain state of character. Although ψυχή is not itself a harmony, it brings all the aspects of a living being into harmony so that the animal can achieve its innate goal or purpose (for humans, the goal of εὐδαιμονία); and music as aliveness and thought expressed through time achieves similar effects.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Aristotle holds that the best actions and states of character are not only good but also pursued for the sake of beauty. For instance, he describes civic courage (defending one's community in battle out of a feeling of obligation or for avoidance of shame) as not even true courage in comparison to courage acted upon because it is the right and beautiful thing to do; similarly for generosity, friendship, and other excellences of character. Just as ethical beauty can be exhibited in a wide range of balanced and mindful actions and reactions (even in your manner of dying), so also music can be beautifully sad or joyous or poignant or powerful or even angry, and can beautifully represent many different states of character. This is why Aristotle thinks the beauty of music suits the best way of life; yet an Aristotelian philosophy of music would not countenance that which is merely pretty, the kind of music-box banality that sounds nice but has no depth or stature, but instead encourage the musical ambition (of scale, sublimity, virtuosity, excellence, and beauty) to match his conception of "greatness of soul" in ethics.</p>
<p>Finally, although Aristotle and the ancient Greeks in general believed that the life of a musician lacked a certain nobility (they thought all the arts were too mechanical), today we would see musical creativity as a form of θεωρία or inquiry because the composer or performer engages in a deep exploration of the possibilities of musical materials and tonal space. Indeed, I would argue that good musical judgment and good musical taste are instances of the Aristotelian intellectual virtues of phronesis and sophia, and thus that the pursuit of musical wisdom is one path toward philosophy as a way of life.</p>
<p>The foregoing is but the merest sketch and does not delve into the specifically <em>musical</em> aspects of a philosophy of music (melody, harmony, rhythm, time, tone, texture, deliberate practice, improvisation, ornament, composition, performance, etc.); nor does it indicate how to apply these principles to a wide variety of musical styles and genres (even just in Western music that would include medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, classical, romantic, and modernist art music as well as jazz, blues, folk, rock, etc.). To expand this kernel of a idea into a worthwhile contribution to the philosophy of music, I would need to complete a great deal of research and reflection. Maybe I'll do that after I finish writing a book on Aristotle's ethics...</p>

<h2><a href="1605.html">Aristotle Research Report #4: ἀρετή</a></h2>
<h3>2018-02-12</h3>
<p>I'm starting to see that Aristotle's conception of ἀρετή (which I translate as thriving but which is more commonly translated as excellence or virtue) describes a deliberate practice of good judgment, reasoned choice, and planned activity resulting in a balance between extremes of action and emotional reaction in a particular domain of human life.</p>
<p>Example: frugality or financial responsibility (not an ἀρετή that Aristotle discusses, by the way). Money troubles are one of the greatest sources of stress in modern times, so doing well in this domain is important to your happiness and success in life. Furthermore, let's say that in your later years you would like to pursue a more beautiful existence through philanthropic activities, devotion to a craft, or a life of inquiry - all of which require you to build up a financial cushion. To achieve your goals, you can't hope to win the lottery or get lucky with a hot investing scheme. Instead, you need to cultivate a deliberate practice of financial responsibility consisting of numerous activities that are based in clear perception, honesty with yourself, good judgment, and other mental thrivings. Such activities might include dedicating a large percentage of your salary to savings, paying your bills on time and in full, saving up for large expenditures, not incurring debt, thinking about the long-term impact of even small costs (like going out to lunch every day), budgeting for and understanding your expenses, investing reasonably without succumbing to fear and greed, etc. You won't learn such practices in philosophy class, but they are directly connected with living well because they help you face financial crises with equanimity, take care of yourself and your family, and engage in finer pursuits later in life.</p>
<p>Failings, too, are practices (say, prodigality or financial irresponsibility as an excess in this area - much more common than the deficiency of cheapness). There is judgment involved, but it's poor judgment. There is choice involved, but it's unreasoned choice. There is planning involved, but for misguided activities (e.g., trips to Las Vegas to shop and gamble). There is willful ignorance instead of constructive knowledge, self-deception instead of truthfulness, etc. All of this bespeaks a stunted humanity in one area of your life - which can bleed over into many other areas, or the whole of it.</p>
<p>Because philosophy is the love and practice of wisdom, a good and deliberate practice in any important domain of life (work, love, family, health, finance, friendship, thought, emotion, etc.) is a philosophical endeavor and an application of philosophical insight to a life well lived. This is the role of ἀρετή in human existence.</p>

<h2><a href="1604.html">Aristotelian Questions</a></h2>
<h3>2018-02-12</h3>
<p>My intent in writing a book on Aristotelian ethics is not to present exactly what Aristotle said (I'll leave that to scholars such as J.O. Urmson in his excellent epitome <cite>Aristotle's Ethics</cite>), but hopefully what he meant and even more pointedly what he means for us 2300+ years later. The goal is to present my own direct encounter with Aristotle, unmediated by millennia of often misguided scholarship and mistranslation. (Ironically, we need some scholarship to do that, so separating the wheat from the chaff is necessary.) Here are some of the questions I'll be trying answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the implications of getting behind the veil of modern and Christianized interpretations of Aristotle's ethical philosophy?</li>
<li>What is the applicability of such a pagan philosophy to life in the 21st century?</li>
<li>For instance: our economy is not based on slavery, women are liberated, work and career are of central importance in life, labor is no longer always demeaning but potentially a source of meaning, mastery of one's craft involves various thrivings of mind and character (many of which are of modern vintage, like productivity), we have a much higher regard for craftmanship than the Greeks did (for whom a sculptor was just a tradesman like a plumber or a carpenter) - what does all that imply for a ranking of the best ways of life?</li>
<li>Can a life of good, interesting, creative, valuable work (as an artist or entrepreneur or doctor or whatever) compete with Aristotle's lifeways of active political leadership and active intellectual inquiry?</li>
<li>The polis was a dead letter as soon as Aristotle's student Alexander created an empire; thus don't we need a more modern conception of the philanthropic way of life to replace Aristotle's second-best ideal of political leadership?</li>
<li>Indeed, isn't there a philanthropic aspect to any work well done? And isn't there an aspect of inquiry in such work, too, of understanding reality and humanity and oneself?</li>
<li>Is it really legitimate for academics to pat themselves on the back about their wonderfully happy lives of inquiry and contemplation when so many of them are just trying to get published and gain tenure, and bickering amongst themselves over scholarly pettifogging and office politics (as Thoreau would say, are they truly philosophers or just professors of philosophy)?</li>
<li>What about philosophy as a way of life? Is that restricted to a life of θεωρία (inquiry) or does the love of wisdom apply to any life well lived? What is the role of φρόνησις (good judgment) and σοφία (wisdom) in the best life for any human being?</li>

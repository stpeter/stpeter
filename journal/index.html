<h2><a href="1595.html">Songs of Zarathustra: First Draft</a></h2>
<h3>2017-11-09</h3>
<p>About eight months ago, even before I published <cite>The Upland Farm</cite> as the fourth volume in my series on the art of living, I started to read Nietzsche's books for a third time, writing poems for <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite> as I worked my way chronologically from <cite>The Birth of Tragedy</cite> through <cite>Ecce Homo</cite>. Last weekend, I completed work on the first draft of this poetry cycle on Nietzsche's philosophy of life, which I plan to publish in early 2018. Before then, I'll read his letters and notebooks (including the ever-controversial collection called "The Will to Power") as well as some of the vast literature on Nietzsche's life and thought, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bruce Benson - Pious Nietzsche</li>
<li>Peter Berkowitz - Ethics of an Immoralist</li>
<li>Curtis Cate - Friedrich Nietzsche</li>
<li>Leslie Chamberlain - Nietzsche in Turin</li>
<li>Paul Deussen - Conversations with Nietzsche</li>
<li>Ronald Hayman - Nietzsche: A Critical Life</li>
<li>F.A. Lea - Tragic Philosopher</li>
<li>Brian Leiter - Nietzsche on Morality</li>
<li>Jill Marsden - After Nietzsche</li>
<li>George Allen Morgan - What Nietzsche Means</li>
<li>Bernard Reginster - The Affirmation of Life</li>
<li>Rudiger Safranski - Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography</li>
<li>Lou Salomé - Nietzsche in His Works</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll post again when <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite> is done and published!</p>

<h2><a href="1594.html">Ultra-Short Poems</a></h2>
<h3>2017-10-08</h3>
<p>Reading a book on Matsuo Bashō has renewed my interest in ultra-short poems. The best-known form here is haiku, which in Japanese consists of three sections of 5, 7, and 5 syllables each. The most famous haiku is probably this one written by Bashō in 1686:</p>
<blockquote>furuike ya kawazu tobikomu mizu no oto</blockquote>
<p>It's often translated as something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
ancient pond<br>
a frog jumps in<br>
water's sound
</blockquote>
<p>Because English has many short words (compare "frog" to "kawazu" or "jumps in" to "tobikomu"), it's possible to write even more concise poems in English than in most other languages. Although I never thought I'd consider haiku to be wordy, compare a few 5-7-5 verses to a few 3-4-3 verses:</p>
<blockquote>
thundering waters<br>
at this distance only seen<br>
make a cooling mist
</blockquote>
<p>vs.</p>
<blockquote>
see the mist?<br>
waters thunder<br>
far away
</blockquote>
<p>Or:</p>
<blockquote>
cicadas buzzing<br>
in well-watered cottonwoods<br>
down in the ravine 
</blockquote>
<p>vs.</p>
<blockquote>
down below<br>
cicadas buzz<br>
in the trees
</blockquote>
<p>Or:</p>
<blockquote>
in this early snow<br>
faded flowers of summer<br>
plastered on the ground
</blockquote>
<p>vs.</p>
<blockquote>
early snow<br>
summer blossoms<br>
plastered ground
</blockquote>
<p>Or this one (appropriate for my collection of urban haiku):</p>
<blockquote>
a couple huddles<br>
with a single umbrella<br>
waiting for the bus
</blockquote>
<p>vs.</p>
<blockquote>
he and she<br>
one umbrella<br>
bus stop bench
</blockquote>
<p>I rather like the even more concise, evocative 3-4-3 format with its mere 10 syllables. I'm not sure if it has a name, but "toku" is a possibility (I think that would be Japanese for "ten-verse", but I've never studied Japanese so I'm only guessing).</p>
<p>Oh, and mimicking Bashō here is a "toku" on Henry David Thoreau:</p>
<blockquote>
Walden pond<br>
Thoreau jumps in<br>
water's sound
</blockquote>

<h2><a href="1593.html">Internationalized RFCs</a></h2>
<h3>2017-10-05</h3>
<p>Ever since the first "Request for Comments" (RFC 1) was published in 1969, the RFC series has been typeset exclusively in ASCII text. It's almost a running joke among technologists and programmers. Yet that is finally changing. The recently-published RFC 8187 marks the first time that RFCs have included Unicode characters and an encoding other than ASCII (i.e., UTF-8). Today, RFCs 8264, 8265, and 8266 take that a step further by using non-ASCII characters in a more thorough-going way; appropriately enough, these three RFCs define revised versions of the PRECIS specifications for the preparation, enforcement, and comparison of internationalized strings in application protocols (thus replacing RFCs 7564, 7613, and 7700, which I authored in 2015). I'm sure many readers never thought they'd see a symbol like ∞ (INFINITY, Unicode code point U+221E) in an RFC, but we did it! Many thanks to the RFC Editor team for making this day possible, and to my co-authors Marc Blanchet and Alexey Melnikov for making this day necessary. ;-)</p>

<h2><a href="1592.html">Asymmetries</a></h2>
<h3>2017-09-23</h3>
<p>Having done a lot of hiring and recruiting lately, I've been struck by the deep asymmetries of information and power involved in the process of building a team. Because the organization has the money, it can compel the applicant (supplicant?) to complete intelligence tests and personality assessments, ask lots of questions about background and knowledge and experience, require completion of a sample work task or delivery of a short-term project, perform background checks, call character references, and just about whatever else the hiring manager or HR department can dream up. Yet how much information does the applicant get to truly learn about the organization or, especially, the hiring manager? Consider that, supposedly, 50% of voluntary terminations occur because the employee does not like or agree with or get along with the employee's manager - yet the fundamental asymmetry of the hiring process means that the employee is mostly in the dark about potential problems in this key aspect of the employment relationship.</p>
<p>What would it look like to create a much more transparent process and level playing field? Consider a few possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conducting truly bidirectional interviews, in which the applicant is given the freedom to ask deep and probing questions - and receive honest answers - about the organization, team, and hiring manager.</li>
<li>Openly sharing information about the hiring manager's personal qualities and performance, in the form of 360˚ feedback results or a personality assessment.</li>
<li>Giving character references about the hiring manager and encouraging the applicant to call those people to determine what the hiring manager is really like as a boss.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you imagine any existing organization allowing such things? If not, what does that tell you about the health of the relationship between an organization and its potential employees?</p>

<h2><a href="1591.html">Providing an Alternative</a></h2>
<h3>2017-08-16</h3>
<p>Although I pay no attention to the news, I'm vaguely aware that perhaps the world is becoming more negative and irrational. Rather than getting lost in despair and confusion, I try to model a positive, reasonable alternative by living the best life I can and by writing philosophical books that are clear, concise, and constructive. I've written six such books, with a seventh half done and an eighth outlined. Even though each of these books takes 500-1000 hours to research and write, I make them all available for free on my website (however, I do charge for the paperback and ebook versions). To date I've also made no effort to market them, so I depend on word of mouth. If you have found value in any of these books, I'd greatly appreciate it if you could tell a friend, write a review at Amazon, or give a copy as a gift. Thanks. :-)</p>

<h2><a href="1590.html">None of My Business</a></h2>
<h3>2017-08-10</h3>
<p>Apropos of my latest journal entry "Politics is a Disease", here is a quote from <cite>Beyond Good and Evil</cite> (Section 251) by Friedrich Nietzsche:</p>
<blockquote>If a people is suffering and wants to suffer from nationalistic nervous fever and political ambition, it must be expected that all sorts of clouds and disturbances - in short, little attacks of stupidity - will pass over its spirit into the bargain: among present-day Germans, for example, now the anti-French stupidity, now the anti-Jewish, now the anti-Polish, now the Christian-romantic, now the Wagnerian, now the Teutonic, now the Prussian (just look at those miserable historians, those Sybels and Treitschkes, with their thickly bandaged heads -), and whatever else these little obfuscations of the German spirit and conscience may be called. May it be forgiven me that I too, during a daring brief sojourn in a highly infected area, did not remain wholly free of the disease and began, like the rest of the world, to entertain ideas about things that were none of my business: first symptom of the political infection.</blockquote>
<p>As Nietzsche hints, the farther a given concern is from one's span of control - to pick a topic of the moment, "what to do about North Korea" - the more readily most people weigh in with their opinions. Yet unless you know a great deal about both the specifics and the conceptual underpinnings of right action in such a matter, the less justified you are to entertain ideas about things that are none of your business. Not, by the way, that I have much confidence in the so-called experts, either!</p>

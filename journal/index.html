<h2><a href="1660.html">Bach on Bass #2: Keys and Tunings</a></h2>
<h3>2021-01-06</h3>
<p>Many questions arise when considering how to climb the mountain of playing Bach's Cello Suites on electric bass. One of the key questions is the question of keys. The original keys for the six suites are G major, D minor, C major, E♭ major, C minor, and D major respectively. Other than the fourth suite, these keys lie naturally on the cello, which is tuned in fifths and whose open strings (from lowest to highest) are tuned C-G-D-A. Thus five of the six suites can benefit from the harmonic resonance of open strings, which is especially important when playing the suites on a Baroque cello. (Those who play in a more Romantic style don't like the notes of the open strings because you can't play with the requisite vibrato.)</p>
<p>The bass, whether double bass or electric bass, is by contrast almost always tuned in fourths: E-A-D-G. As a result, the two suites in C and the suite in G no longer lie naturally on the instrument. Many bassists work around the problem by transposing to new keys (e.g., transposing all the suites down a fourth as Mark of Bach2Bass.com has done or using some other heuristic for new keys as Paolo Rizzi did in his sheet music edition for Recordi).</p>
<p>But notice that phrase "almost always" in the preceding paragraph. Another approach is to <em>tune the bass in fifths</em>: C-G-D-A, just like the cello but one octave lower. Now you can play all the suites in the original keys and take advantage of those open strings. The biggest downside is that you have to retrain your fingers (all that muscle memory of how to navigate the fingerboard in fourths!). Jazz double bassist Red Mitchell started doing this back in the 1960s; following Mitchell's lead, classical double bassist Joel Quarrington has made a compelling case for tuning in fifths and has influenced a number of bassists to follow suit, especially in his native Canada.</p>
<p>I've been experimenting with fifths tuning and to my mind (and ears) it makes a lot of sense. Finger retraining is in progress! Unfortunately there are some instrumental challenges involved, which I'll cover in the next installment.</p>

<h2><a href="1659.html">Bach on Bass #1: Fascination</a></h2>
<h3>2021-01-05</h3>
<p>Fascination is what I've long felt about Bach's Suites for Unaccompanied Cello. I'm not sure when I first heard them, but over time they have become ever more meaningful to me. I regularly listen to various recorded renditions - some of my favorites are by Stephen Isserlis (cello), Patricia McCarty (viola), Edgar Meyer (double bass), Michael Nicolella (guitar), Jean-Guihen Queyras (cello), Hopkinson Smith (lute), Janos Starker (cello), and Pieter Wispelwey (cello). So far, that is - I'm actively adding more recordings to my collection as I explore these works ever more deeply.</p>
<p>Naturally, you can't understand a piece of music inside and out unless you can play it. Thus ten years ago or more was born my aspiration to learn the cello suites on electric bass (more realistic for me than an arrangement for guitar or than learning a completely new instrument). Until now I haven't done much in pursuit of that goal, other than learn the Sarabande of the 5th Suite. However, I'm now getting serious about it and will describe this long mountain climb (Stephen Isserlis once said these pieces are the Himalayas of the cello repertoire) in a series of journal posts. If I ever reach the summit, I might even record them someday.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for updates.</p>

<h2><a href="1658.html">Monadnock Valley Press Annual Report 2020</a></h2>
<h3>2021-01-01</h3>
<p>Apparently I got out of the habit of writing a brief "annual report" for the Monadnock Valley Press, under whose auspices I both post public-domain texts (at monadnock.net) and publish the philosophy books I write on the side. So it's about time to remedy the oversight, since the last report was for 2016.</p>
<p>It turns out that 2020 was a good year for my public-domain postings. As catalogued in the publishing chronology linked below, I republished public-domain works by Lord Acton, Louisa May Alcott, Lord Byron, John Donne, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Benjamin Franklin, Robert Frost, Langston Hughes, Henrik Ibsen, John Stuart Mill, Michel de Montaigne, Thomas Paine, Edwin Arlington Robinson, Edmond Rostand, Arthur Schopenhauer, Philip Sidney, Sophocles, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Chidiock Tichborne, Voltaire, George Washington, and Yevgeny Zamyatin. That was much more than I expected; perhaps this activity was a pleasant distraction from all the turmoil in 2020. My publication roadmap for 2021 is not nearly so full, but perhaps I'll post more than I currently envision.</p>
<p>A quick look at sales reveals that I earned a whopping $375 on my books this year, which I'm sure was far offset by research and development expenses, i.e., all the scholarly books I bought in preparation for writing an epitome of Aristotle's ethics. C'est la vie.</p>

<h2><a href="1657.html">2020 Readings</a></h2>

<h2><a href="1656.html">Who Was Aristotle?</a></h2>
<h3>2020-11-24</h3>
<p>Greatness is out of fashion these days -- even suspect because of its seeming elitism. Yet it is an inconvenient truth that talents, opportunities, efforts, and achievements vary greatly. In every field of human endeavor there are only a few people who are remembered even 50 years after their passing; multiply 50 by 50 and we reach 2500 years, nearly the upper limit of recorded history, whose rolls are inhabited by a minuscule percentage of those who have ever lived. Even fewer of those remembered are anything but a name, whose works and deeds are still widely studied to this day. At the very pinnacle of these is Aristotle, whose concepts and insights form the foundation of much of human knowledge, science, art, culture, and society.</p>
<p>But who was Aristotle? He was, of course, no more a disembodied mind than any other human being. He had parents (who died when he was a child), an older sister and a younger brother, a wife (who also died young) by whom he had a daughter, another partner after his wife died by whom he had a son, friends, enemies, teachers, schoolmates, colleagues, students, servants, and some very powerful people whom he served and befriended as well. Although the facts of his life are hazy indeed 2400 years later, if the reconstructions of Carlo Natali and especially Anton-Hermann Chroust are close to the mark then he lived quite an eventful life, not just of scholarship but of political influence and something approaching intrigue.</p>
<p>Aristotle was born in 384 BC at a town in northern Greece (almost in Macedonia) called Stagira, a colony founded earlier by the cities of Chalkis and Andros. On both his father's side and his mother's side he was said to be descended from Asclepius, a physician mentioned in <cite>The Iliad</cite> of Homer. His father's family came from Andros and his mother's from Chalkis. His mother Phaestis was apparently from a well-to-do family of Chalkis, where they owned an estate. His father Nicomachus was the court physician to and perhaps a friend and confidant of Amyntas III, the king of Macedonia.</p>
<p>Amyntas died in 370 BC when Aristotle was 14 and Aristotle's parents died before Aristotle went to Athens in 367 BC, so it's possible that Nicomachus and Phaestis were killed during the royal intrigues that followed the death of Amyntas and before the ascension of King Philip II in 359 BC. Aristotle's older sister Arimineste married a man (seemingly a distant relative) named Proxenus and was then put under their care and guidance, it appears across the Aegean Sea at Atarneus on the western coast of Asia Minor. At age 16 or 17 Aristotle went to Athens for further education, perhaps initially with the rhetorician and philosopher Isocrates and then with Plato once the latter returned from an ill-fated venture in Syracuse in southern Italy. Aristotle spent the next 20 years as an active member of the Academy, Plato's school and research community, where he studied and eventually taught.</p>
<p>In 348 or 347 BC, Aristotle left the Academy under circumstances that are unclear. Some accounts say that he left after the death of Plato in 347 BC, but others say that he left in 348 BC before Plato died. Why would he have left sooner? Chroust speculates that Aristotle, with his Macedonian connections, was forced to leave because of anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens stirred up by the fall of Olynthus to the forces of King Philip in the summer of 348 BC. Aristotle went not to Chalkis on the island of Euboea (which was in a state of chaos at the time) but to Atarneus. Here he became a friend and adviser to Hermias, the ruler of Atarneus. While in Atarneus he met and married a woman named Pythia, the daughter or niece of Hermias, with whom he had a daughter also named Pythia.</p>
<p>Scholars of a philosophical bent think that Aristotle went to Atarneus (and then nearby Assos and Mytilene) to study biology. He certainly did study there, but Chroust argues that Aristotle was also engaged in diplomatic missions from King Philip to Hermias, since Atarneus would have provided a beachhead for Philip's planned invasion of Persia. Perhaps the Persian king Artaxerxes I got wind of such machinations, because he had Hermias captured, tortured, and killed in 342 BC.</p>
<p>By then Aristotle might have relocated to Macedonia (Herpyllis, his common-law wife after the death of Pythia and the mother of his son Nicomachus, was from Stagira). Legend has it that Philip called upon Aristotle to tutor his son Alexander (the future Alexander the Great), although there is no early evidence for this relationship (indeed, the Epicureans and Stoics would have loved to pin Alexander's character failings on his teacher Aristotle, but they never mentioned it among their many calumnies). Philip himself was assassinated in 336 BC, whereupon the young Alexander ascended to the throne and proceeded to conquer all of Greece. Amongst the ensuing squabbles, it's possible that Aristotle convinced Alexander to spare the city of Athens, which had revolted along with Thebes (which Alexander destroyed) when rumors spread that Alexander had been killed in fighting the Illyrians. Perhaps not coincidentally, Aristotle returned to Athens in 335 BC, where he founded his own school (the Lyceum) and spent the next thirteen years while Alexander went off to conquer Asia.</p>
<p>During Alexander's prolonged absence, he put one of Philip's old generals, Antipater, in charge of keeping the peace back in Greece. It seems that Aristotle and Antipater had a close relationship (indeed, Antipater was the executor for Aristotle's last will and testament) and they exchanged many letters (which might have included reports from Aristotle on the political situation in Athens). When Alexander died at Babylon in 323 BC, Aristotle once again fled Athens because of anti-Macedonian agitation, which this time took the form of a charge of impiety against Aristotle (the same charge which had led to the execution of Socrates in 399 BC). To prevent the Athenians from "sinning twice against philosophy", Aristotle fled to the estate of his mother's family in Chalkis, where he died soon after in 322 BC at the age of 62, perhaps of stomach cancer.</p>
<p>Thus we can see that Aristotle led a full and eventful life. In the midst of all this, Aristotle founded the sciences of logic and biology, wrote hundreds of popular and scholarly works on an enormous range of subjects, taught numerous students, and contributed fundamentally to epistemology, metaphysics, psychology, rhetoric, literary analysis, political theory, and ethics. Although he was not without a few faults, his intellectual legacy is immense and will never be equalled.</p>
<p>What was Aristotle like as a person? That's hard to say. Unlike Socrates, he never served in the military and never had to work for a living, although as we've seen the ancient sources indicate that he was quite active in diplomatic affairs. Unlike Plato, Epicurus, and many other ancient (and modern) philosophers, Aristotle married and had children, to whom he was very devoted (as witness the great care he expended in his will to ensure that his deceased relations would be remembered and that his living relations would be cared for). Also in his will he made provisions to free the slaves he inherited with generous stipends so that they could support themselves. He seems to have been a steadfast friend to powerful men like Philip, Hermias, and Antipater as well as to colleagues in learning like Plato, Theophrastus, and Xenocrates. Clearly he worked extremely hard to understand the world around him; but he also, through his popular writings and his teaching, put a great deal of thought and effort into convincing other people (especially rich young aristocrats) to take life seriously through philosophical exploration instead of, say, military expeditions or the pursuit of mindless pleasures.</p>
<p>Socrates said that the unexamined life is not worth living; Aristotle examined <em>everything</em> so deeply that we could say his life was more worth living than that of any other person in human history. That, my friends, is greatness.</p>

<h2><a href="1655.html">It Was Twenty Years Ago Today</a></h2>
<h3>2020-11-21</h3>
<p>On November 21st, 2000, I posted the first entry in this online journal. Although I had tried my hand at writing a weblog even before then (e.g., using a tool for posting entries through a Jabber messaging app), writing at my own website was more appealing. Given that I'm still posting here twenty years later, I declare my original experiment a success. Here's how I characterized this space in that first entry:</p>
<blockquote>I see this space as part diary, part sandbox, and part weblog -- a place to explore ideas and events on the web, in real life, and in my head.</blockquote>
<p>That's still very much the case. Although the topics I explore aren't quite the same (for instance, I rarely post about technology or politics any longer) and although my perspectives aren't quite the same, I perceive more continuity than change in the 1655 entries I've posted so far.</p>
<p>Here's to the next twenty years!</p>

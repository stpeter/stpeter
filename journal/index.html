<h2><a href="1597.html">Jabber.org Account Experiment</a></h2>
<h3>2017-11-29</h3>
<p>In early August I started an experiment to once again offer accounts at the Jabber.org messaging service, where we had turned off account creation several years ago. Given that today is my "Jabiversary" (it was 18 years ago that I first posted to the JDEV discussion list!), I figured I'd end the experiment today and report on the results. My two goals with the experiment were (1) to see if people still want Jabber.org accounts and (2) to informally poll people about donating money to help us run the service, which has been absolutely free since 1999 (e.g., we might use funds to purchase new equipment or pay for individuals to fix bugs, create new features, maintain our infrastructure, offer customer support, etc.). On both counts I would say the experiment was a qualified success: I received over 1000 account requests in 4 months and at least 30% of respondents said they would be happy to donate (some even sent me cash in the mail or payments via PayPal). Based on these results, I am encouraged to move forward with opening up automated account creation again (probably in early 2018) and with establishing a formal organization (e.g., a non-profit or cooperative) to run the service so that we can open a bank account and accept donations. Stay tuned for more details on both fronts! (Oh, and if you really really need an account between now and early 2018, I can still create one for you manually.)</p>

<h2><a href="1596.html">Joining Mozilla</a></h2>
<h3>2017-11-26</h3>
<p>I'm overjoyed to announce that I'm joining Mozilla, makers of the Firefox web browser. I've been using Mozilla software since Milestone 8 of the original browser release in July of 1999, so this feels like coming home. More important, Mozilla's mission of defending the open web is completely consistent with my own commitment to open source and open standards (as demonstrated through my work on Jabber/XMPP and IETF standards for the past 18 years). I have deep respect for what the Mozilla team has accomplished, both architecturally and organizationally, and I'm extremely excited about helping to make Mozilla an even stronger force for good in the world!</p>

<h2><a href="1595.html">Songs of Zarathustra: First Draft</a></h2>
<h3>2017-11-09</h3>
<p>About eight months ago, even before I published <cite>The Upland Farm</cite> as the fourth volume in my series on the art of living, I started to read Nietzsche's books for a third time, writing poems for <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite> as I worked my way chronologically from <cite>The Birth of Tragedy</cite> through <cite>Ecce Homo</cite>. Last weekend, I completed work on the first draft of this poetry cycle on Nietzsche's philosophy of life, which I plan to publish in early 2018. Before then, I'll read his letters and notebooks (including the ever-controversial collection called "The Will to Power") as well as some of the vast literature on Nietzsche's life and thought, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bruce Benson - Pious Nietzsche</li>
<li>Peter Berkowitz - Nietzsche: The Ethics of an Immoralist</li>
<li>Curtis Cate - Friedrich Nietzsche</li>
<li>Leslie Chamberlain - Nietzsche in Turin</li>
<li>Paul Deussen - Conversations with Nietzsche</li>
<li>Ronald Hayman - Nietzsche: A Critical Life</li>
<li>F.A. Lea - Tragic Philosopher</li>
<li>Brian Leiter - Nietzsche on Morality</li>
<li>Jill Marsden - After Nietzsche</li>
<li>George Allen Morgan - What Nietzsche Means</li>
<li>Bernard Reginster - The Affirmation of Life</li>
<li>Rudiger Safranski - Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography</li>
<li>Lou Salomé - Nietzsche in His Works</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll post again when <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite> is done and published!</p>

<h2><a href="1594.html">Ultra-Short Poems</a></h2>
<h3>2017-10-08</h3>
<p>Reading a book on Matsuo Bashō has renewed my interest in ultra-short poems. The best-known form here is haiku, which in Japanese consists of three sections of 5, 7, and 5 syllables each. The most famous haiku is probably this one written by Bashō in 1686:</p>
<blockquote>furuike ya kawazu tobikomu mizu no oto</blockquote>
<p>It's often translated as something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
ancient pond<br>
a frog jumps in<br>
water's sound
</blockquote>
<p>Because English has many short words (compare "frog" to "kawazu" or "jumps in" to "tobikomu"), it's possible to write even more concise poems in English than in most other languages. Although I never thought I'd consider haiku to be wordy, compare a few 5-7-5 verses to a few 3-4-3 verses:</p>
<blockquote>
thundering waters<br>
at this distance only seen<br>
make a cooling mist
</blockquote>
<p>vs.</p>
<blockquote>
see the mist?<br>
waters thunder<br>
far away
</blockquote>
<p>Or:</p>
<blockquote>
cicadas buzzing<br>
in well-watered cottonwoods<br>
down in the ravine 
</blockquote>
<p>vs.</p>
<blockquote>
down below<br>
cicadas buzz<br>
in the trees
</blockquote>
<p>Or:</p>
<blockquote>
in this early snow<br>
faded flowers of summer<br>
plastered on the ground
</blockquote>
<p>vs.</p>
<blockquote>
early snow<br>
summer blossoms<br>
plastered ground
</blockquote>
<p>Or this one (appropriate for my collection of urban haiku):</p>
<blockquote>
a couple huddles<br>
with a single umbrella<br>
waiting for the bus
</blockquote>
<p>vs.</p>
<blockquote>
he and she<br>
one umbrella<br>
bus stop bench
</blockquote>
<p>I rather like the even more concise, evocative 3-4-3 format with its mere 10 syllables. I'm not sure if it has a name (most poets just call it a haiku), but "toku" is a possibility (I think that would be Japanese for "ten-verse", but I've never studied Japanese so I'm only guessing).</p>
<p>Oh, and mimicking Bashō here is a haiku on Henry David Thoreau:</p>
<blockquote>
Walden pond<br>
Thoreau jumps in<br>
water's sound
</blockquote>

<h2><a href="1593.html">Internationalized RFCs</a></h2>
<h3>2017-10-05</h3>
<p>Ever since the first "Request for Comments" (RFC 1) was published in 1969, the RFC series has been typeset exclusively in ASCII text. It's almost a running joke among technologists and programmers. Yet that is finally changing. The recently-published RFC 8187 marks the first time that RFCs have included Unicode characters and an encoding other than ASCII (i.e., UTF-8). Today, RFCs 8264, 8265, and 8266 take that a step further by using non-ASCII characters in a more thorough-going way; appropriately enough, these three RFCs define revised versions of the PRECIS specifications for the preparation, enforcement, and comparison of internationalized strings in application protocols (thus replacing RFCs 7564, 7613, and 7700, which I authored in 2015). I'm sure many readers never thought they'd see a symbol like ∞ (INFINITY, Unicode code point U+221E) in an RFC, but we did it! Many thanks to the RFC Editor team for making this day possible, and to my co-authors Marc Blanchet and Alexey Melnikov for making this day necessary. ;-)</p>

<h2><a href="1592.html">Asymmetries</a></h2>
<h3>2017-09-23</h3>
<p>Having done a lot of hiring and recruiting lately, I've been struck by the deep asymmetries of information and power involved in the process of building a team. Because the organization has the money, it can compel the applicant (supplicant?) to complete intelligence tests and personality assessments, ask lots of questions about background and knowledge and experience, require completion of a sample work task or delivery of a short-term project, perform background checks, call character references, and just about whatever else the hiring manager or HR department can dream up. Yet how much information does the applicant get to truly learn about the organization or, especially, the hiring manager? Consider that, supposedly, 50% of voluntary terminations occur because the employee does not like or agree with or get along with the employee's manager - yet the fundamental asymmetry of the hiring process means that the employee is mostly in the dark about potential problems in this key aspect of the employment relationship.</p>
<p>What would it look like to create a much more transparent process and level playing field? Consider a few possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conducting truly bidirectional interviews, in which the applicant is given the freedom to ask deep and probing questions - and receive honest answers - about the organization, team, and hiring manager.</li>
<li>Openly sharing information about the hiring manager's personal qualities and performance, in the form of 360˚ feedback results or a personality assessment.</li>
<li>Giving character references about the hiring manager and encouraging the applicant to call those people to determine what the hiring manager is really like as a boss.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you imagine any existing organization allowing such things? If not, what does that tell you about the health of the relationship between an organization and its potential employees?</p>

    <p>The OED says this about "whelm" as a transitive verb:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>To cover completely with water or other fluid so as to ruin or destroy; to submerge, drown; occasionally, to sink (a boat).</li>
        <li>To bury under a load of earth, snow, or the like.</li>
        <li>To engulf or bear down like a flood, storm, avalanche, etc.; hence to involve in destruction or ruin.</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I think I am now officially whelmed by work.</p>

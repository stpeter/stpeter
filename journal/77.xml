<p>Here's a rant in verse that I just wrote. I'm not sure that it rises to the level of a poem, but it's kinda fun nonetheless&hellip;</p>
<p>
I hate the smell of popcorn,<br />
the artificial butter<br />
and fake salt (for all I know)<br />
waft so insidiously that<br />
I breathe only through my mouth &mdash;<br />
it makes my throat so dry I<br />
gasp for water and fresh air.<br />
Besides it reminds me of<br />
the movie theatre &mdash; did I<br />
mention that I hate movies?<br />
They make me ill, the moving<br />
pictures and unrealistic<br />
assumptions and patronizing<br />
themes grate on me to no end.<br />
And don't even get me started on<br />
television. Not a word<br />
will I say about <em>that</em> fine<br />
institution, nor about<br />
shopping malls and credit cards,<br />
hot dogs and Coca-Cola.<br />
I guess I must be anti-<br />
American. Yet I love<br />
baseball, the Constitution,<br />
the poetry of Whitman,<br />
the music of Ellington,<br />
and flags of red and white and<br />
blue and only thirteen stars.<br />
But I guess some would say that's<br />
anti-American too.

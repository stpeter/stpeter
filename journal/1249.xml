<p>The folks over in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF land</a> recently had a nice long <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf/current/msg52048.html">discussion thread</a> about the use of <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</a> requirements terms like "MUST", "SHOULD", and "MAY". Even though I've written a few RFCs myself, I found the discussion illuminating. Here are my lessons learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you mean must, should, or may in their special requirements sense, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf/current/msg52194.html">capitalize them</a>.</li>
<li>If you don't mean must, should, or may in their special requirements sense, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf/current/msg52156.html">don't use them</a> (instead, use words like "ought", "might", "can", and other such constructions).</li>
<li>It's better to say <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf/current/msg52104.html">MUST do A unless Y occurs</a> than to say <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf/current/msg52119.html">SHOULD do A but without explaining why</a>, so <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf/current/msg52123.html">avoid SHOULD</a>.</li>
<li>Changing SHOULD to MUST may leave older implementations in non-compliance, but that is the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf/current/msg52132.html">fault of the spec writer</a>, so just admit you were wrong, change the SHOULD to MUST, and note that older implementations will follow the old SHOULD so newer implementations MUST accept the old behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've been <a href="http://svn.xmpp.org:18080/browse/XMPP/trunk/internet-drafts/draft-saintandre-rfc3920bis-07.xml">updating rfc3920bis</a> along these lines (I finished this evening) and next I'll do the same for rfc3921bis.</p>

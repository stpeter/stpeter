<p>Rachel Lucas has posted a guest blog entry on <a href="http://www.rachellucas.com/archives/000218.html#000218">guns and freedom</a> by one Bill Whittle (who, like me, does not and never has owned a gun). Most decidedly worth reading in its entirety. (Thanks to <a href="http://www.geekpress.com/">GeekPress</a> for the link.)</p>

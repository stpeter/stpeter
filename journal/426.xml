<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a>, I was recently reminded that September 11 is also the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/11/newsid_3199000/3199155.stm">anniversary</a> of the coup in Chile that removed the democratically elected president Salvador Allende from power, resulting in many years of repressive rule by General Augusto Pinochet ("at least 3,000 people were killed or disappeared during his 17 years in charge" according to the BBC). Pinochet liberalized the economy but otherwise stifled dissent, leading to a widespread and lasting association between free markets and authoritarian rule throughout Latin America. The worst of it for Americans is that the central government of the United States of America encouraged the coup, leading even further to an association between America and support for authoritarianism. When will we ever learn that the principle of non-interventionism is the only proper basis for the foreign policy of a free nation?</p>

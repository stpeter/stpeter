<p>When <a href='1388.html'>last I mentioned</a> my work on the text of Ayn Rand's novel <a href='http://www.monadnock.net/rand/anthem.html'>Anthem</a>, I noted that I would need to inspect the galley proofs housed at the Library of Congress in order to complete my research. The other day while passing through the D.C. area I did exactly that. The results are somewhat anti-climactic: I've determined that the first American edition of 1946 is canonical. Nevertheless, I have updated my <a href='http://www.monadnock.net/rand/anthem-notes.html'>textual notes</a> to reflect the results of my research, so that no one else need be confused about which text is definitive.</p>

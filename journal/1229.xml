<p>I'm working all the time these days, so I don't have the time to write blog entries of a contemplative nature. But I wanted to acknowledge a <a href="http://powerofnarrative.blogspot.com/2008/02/flecks-of-light-points-of-understanding.html">beautiful post</a> I found recently at <a href="http://powerofnarrative.blogspot.com/">Arthur Silber's blog</a>. I don't know whether the post is primarily about music, politics, ethics, or philosophy &mdash; all four (and more), I think, which to my mind puts it in the same class as the essays of <a href="/writings/rand/gould.html">Glenn Gould</a> (and that, for me, is high praise). So thank you, Arthur, for writing so well, caring so deeply, and thinking so independently.</p>

<header><title>RFC 6702: IETF IPR Compliance</title><date>2012-08-14</date></header>
<entry>
<p>I've had another document published in the <a href='http://www.rfc-editor.org/RFCoverview.html'>RFC series</a>, entitled "Promoting Compliance with Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Disclosure Rules" (<a href='http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6702'>RFC 6702</a>). Tim Polk was the one to see the need for this document, and I volunteered to co-author it with him. Both us have witnessed the problems that can arise from late disclosure of patent claims related to technologies being developed at the IETF, so we decided to do something about it by suggesting several ways for working group chairs and area directors to promote compliance with the IETF's rules about IPR disclosure. Yes, this (along with the companion <a href='http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6702'>RFC 6701</a>) is just a boring but necessary process document. :-) The next set of RFCs I publish should be much more interesting, since they will define an internationalization technology for application protocols.</p>

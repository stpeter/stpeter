<p>This evening I finished reading <a href="http://isbn.nu/0452282152">Girl With a Pearl Earring</a> by Tracy Chevalier. It is a rare event for me to read a novel -- usually I read dry books of history or science, and once in a while some poetry. But this is a rare novel, which weaves a sensitive story of a girl's coming of age and the meaning of art around Vermeer's painting <a href="http://www.mauritshuis.nl/collectie/portretten/art/meisje_met_parel.jpg">Girl With a Pearl Earring</a> (uit Nederlands, "Meisje met de parel"). Highly recommended.</p>

<p>Jabber technologies have always been optimized for sending many small pieces of structured data, which we call XML stanzas. As a result we've struggled with ways to send binary data &mdash; even small bits of binary. Out of that need emerged <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0231.html">XEP-0231</a>, which I recently renamed "bits of binary" (a.k.a. "BoB") because I like catchy spec titles (hey, it's one of the things that keep me going). Folks like <a href="http://ralphm.net/blog/">Ralph Meijer</a> have had vague worries about the approach we'd taken in that spec, but we needed it for anti-spam <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0158.html">CAPTCHA forms</a> so we kind of brushed those aside because we need to fight spam, right?</p>
<p>Then over the last few weeks <a href="http://pavlix.net/">Pavel &#x160;imerda</a> raised some further concerns and, more productively, suggested solutions. So Pavel and I have been collaborating on revisions in a longish <a href="http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/2008-July/019344.html">email thread</a>, in a <a href="http://logs.jabber.org/jdev@conference.jabber.org/2008-08-06.html#12:56:16">groupchat</a> the other day, and in <a href="http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/2008-August/019470.html">follow-up email thread</a>. Pavel has been a pleasure to work with and it was fun to make such significant progress in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>Best of all, I think "BoB" is one of those building block technologies that we'll be able to use for features like emoticons, thumbnails for file transfer, in-line images in messages and whiteboarding sessions, and yes those CAPTCHA forms for joining chatrooms or initiating presence subscriptions.</p>
<p>So here's to BoB! :-)</p>

<p>Lawrence Reed of the Makinac Center asks his fellow libertarians <a href="http://www.mackinac.org/3942">when will we know when we've won?</a> One of his criteria: when the term 'liberalism' means what it still means outside the USA and what it originally meant here before it was hijacked by moderate socialists: full respect for liberty. We might as well start now. Repeat after me: "I am a liberal." :-)</p>

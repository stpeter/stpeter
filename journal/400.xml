<p>My musical tastes are, shall we say, eclectic. I like everything from Palestrina to the Police, and I've been known to listen in short succession to music as disparate as Bach's Art of the Fugue and Professor Longhair, Chopin and Spock's Beard, or James P. Johnson and Bob Marley. Way before the late-90s swing revival I was happily listening to Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Fats Waller, Duke Ellington, and the like. I've been playing that kind of music for quite a while, too, so I'm thinking I might record some of my renditions of classic jazz and show tunes once I buy some recording gear. Here are some songs I've got in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm Beginning to See the Light (Ellington)</li>
<li>I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart (Ellington)</li>
<li>Don't Get Around Much Anymore (Ellington)</li>
<li>They All Laughed (Gershwin)</li>
<li>Summertime (Gershwin)</li>
<li>Stormy Weather (Arlen)</li>
<li>Let's Fall in Love (Arlen)</li>
<li>Over the Rainbow (Arlen) in this cool arrangement I've made for solo guitar</li>
<li>I'm Crazy 'bout My Baby and My Baby's Crazy 'bout Me (Waller), which I first heard on the great <a href="http://isbn.nu/B00004U1H1">Satch Plays Fats</a></li>
<li>The Nearness of You (Carmichael &amp; Washington)</li>
<li>All of Me (Simons &amp; Marks)</li>
<li>Them There Eyes (Pinkard, Tracy &amp; Tauber)</li>
<li>Brother Can You Spare a Dime (Harburg &amp; Gorney)</li>
<li>Bird Alone (an amazing song from <a href="http://isbn.nu/B0000046K6">You Gotta Pay the Band</a> by Abbey Lincoln)</li>
</ul>
<p>Probably much work to be done on arrangements for tunes like this, though&hellip;</p>

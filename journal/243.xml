<p>I've been listening to a lot of music by <a href="http://www.spocksbeard.com/">Spock's Beard</a> lately. Never heard of 'em? Most people haven't, but they are (IMHO) the best progressive rock band of the last ten years. I do have a few nits: sometimes they stray too far over onto the metal side of the world for my taste, a few of their pieces are positively malevolent (e.g., "The Gypsy"), and they have a theatrical side that sounds a bit too much like Queen once in a while. But you can't argue with <a href="http://www.spocksbeard.com/d_kind.htm">The Kindness of Strangers</a>, <a href="http://www.spocksbeard.com/d_day.htm">Day for Night</a>, and <a href="http://www.spocksbeard.com/d_v.htm">V</a> -- these are three excellent recordings (<cite>Day for Night</cite> is my favorite). So check out "the Beard" if you like music from those old progressive bands like Yes, Pink Floyd, and ELP.</p>

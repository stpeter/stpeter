    <p>I doubt I will vote this year (or, perhaps, ever again). I am beginning to see that seeking change through politics is simply the wrong way to go about remaking the world. Besides, my views are so far outside the mainstream -- or so unlikely to be brought into being through the political process -- that it is pointless to vote. If someone supported the following positions I might be tempted to vote:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No more foreign adventures. Period.</li>
        <li><a href="424.html">Give the schools to the teachers</a>.</li>
        <li>Give the courts to the judges.</li>
        <li>Replace fiat money with gold.</li>
        <li>Replace standing armies with local militias.</li>
        <li>Abolish the federal government.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>And that's just for starters. :-)</p>

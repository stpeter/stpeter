<p>A man named <a href="http://www.freetimmasters.com/">Tim Masters</a> was recently released in Colorado after 10+ years in prison upon the discovery of DNA evidence implicating another suspect. Similarly, a serial killer in the Denver area was recently implicated in a murder case that had been unsolved for over 20 years, again based on DNA evidence. As more stories like this emerge, I predict that eventually we will hear calls for a universal DNA database.

<p><a href="1172.html">Speaking</a> of Anton&#xED;n Dvo&#x159;&#xE1;k, I have been listening a lot recently to his Cyp&#x159;&#xED;&#x161;e (Cypresses), a song cycle that he arranged for string quartet. If you can find it, I recommend the recording by the Panocha Quartet on the Supraphon label. This is some of the most painfully gorgeous music I have ever heard.</p>

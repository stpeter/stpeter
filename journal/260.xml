<p>Sadly, I must agree with Diana Hsieh's <a href="http://www.dianahsieh.com/blog/2002_07_14_weekly.html#85251096">report</a> on the Colorado Libertarian Party convention. There's a reason the LP is so feckless: they don't have a positive program of any kind, and they're more interested in legalizing drugs than in clear thinking or creative achievement. I played guitar at the opening reception, and during that time two people came up to me and asked me if I wanted a joint. Hey, I'm all in favor of decriminalizing drug possession and the War on Drugs is deeply harmful to society, but I've never even so much as smoked a cigarette and there are a lot better things to do with one's all-too-brief span on earth than smoke weed. Yet another reason I still feel politically homeless.</p>

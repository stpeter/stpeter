<p>Today's "Friday Jazz" recording is <a href="http://www.allaboutjazz.com/reviews/r0299_31.htm">Oscar Peterson Live at the Northsea Jazz Festival</a>. Definitely a non-standard line-up: Peterson on piano, the amazing Joe Pass on guitar, Niels-Henning Orsted-Pedersen on bass, and Toots Thielemans on harmonica. These guys were cooking! The interplay among these seasoned musicians is something to marvel at; they know when to keep out of each other's way and when some friendly competition is in order. I especially like their lengthy rendition of Duke Ellington's "Caravan". Hot stuff!</p>

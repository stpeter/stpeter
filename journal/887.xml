    <p><a href="886.html">Speaking</a> of playlists and such, I've been playing around with playlists in iTunes. Although I typically listen to whatever the original artist dished up -- yes, in the old days we used to call those "albums" :P -- it can be fun, even enlightening, to remix an artist's output in new ways. One of my favorite recent playlists is a collection of what I think of as some of the bright, shorter (less than 10 minutes), upbeat songs by <a href="http://yesworld.com">Yes</a> from their first ten studio albums. Here's what I came up with:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I See You (from <cite>Yes</cite>, 1969)</li>
      <li>The Prophet (from <cite>Time and a Word</cite>, 1970)</li>
      <li>Yours Is No Disgrace (from <cite>The Yes Album</cite>, 1970)</li>
      <li>Roundabout (from <cite>Fragile</cite>, 1971)</li>
      <li>Siberian Khatru (from <cite>Close to the Edge</cite>, 1972)</li>
      <li>Sound Chaser (from <cite>Relayer</cite>, 1974)</li>
      <li>Going for the One (from <cite>Going for the One</cite>, 1977)</li>
      <li>On the Silent Wings of Freedom (from <cite>Tormato</cite>, 1978)</li>
      <li>Tempus Fugit (from <cite>Drama</cite>, 1980)</li>
    </ol>

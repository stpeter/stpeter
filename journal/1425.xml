<p>As part of my <a href="1300.html">continuing</a> <a href="1415.html">effort</a> to translate the extant writings of <a href="http://monadnock.net/epicurus/">Epicurus</a> on ethics, I've completed a first draft of <a href="http://monadnock.net/epicurus/fragments.html">selected fragments</a> from works of his that were lost in antiquity.</p>
<p>Next I plan to translate his "Letter to Menoeceus".</p>

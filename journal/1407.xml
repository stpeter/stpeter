<p>As <a href="1398.html">promised</a> 6+ months ago, I've posted the text of the final essay to be included in my book <a href="/writings/rand/">Randian Reflections</a>, entitled <a href="/writings/rand/nietzsche-rand.html">Nietzsche, Rand, and the Ethics of the Great Task</a>. I hadn't intended to publish it for a few more months, but I was in the files fixing various markup issues (all of the chapters are now XHTML 1.1 compliant according to the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C validator</a>), so I figured I'd post the last chapter while I was at it. Now I just need to finish off <a href="http://tao-of-roark.com/">The Tao of Roark</a> (lots of notes but not much writing over the last few months) and I'll be done with my Rand-related projects. I'm looking forward to <a href="95.html">letting go of the ladder</a>&hellip;</p>

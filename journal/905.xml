    <p>As mentioned, I've been <a href="900.html">working</a> on my <a href="894.html">personal productivity habits</a>. I'm happy to report that after 7 days my inbox is still empty! Also I've updated the format of my dotplan to better reflect project priorities and the specific tasks I need to complete on each project (plus it's sortable now, too). So far I've studiously avoided the need to perform time and motion studies in my efforts to become a more productive individual... ;-)</p>
    <p>OK, back to work!</p>

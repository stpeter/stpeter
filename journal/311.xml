<p>Here's another quote from <cite>Human, All Too Human</cite> that I enjoyed recently:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Not suited to be a party man.</em> &mdash; He who thinks a great deal is not suited to be a party man: he thinks his way through the party and out the other side too soon. (Volume 1, &#xA7;579)</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps that explains why I'm no longer enamored of the Libertarian Party.</p>

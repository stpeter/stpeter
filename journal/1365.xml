<p>As part of some changes to the VPS that <a href="https://blog.dizzyd.com/">Dizzy</a> and I have shared for a number of years, I've just migrated the XMPP server that I run at stpeter.im from ejabberd 1.x to <a href="https://prosody.im/">Prosody</a>. So far I like Prosody quite a bit: it's a lean little server that's very easy to install and configure, especially on Debian. It's even got an ejabberd2prosody migration script, but I was too lazy to run that so I've wiped my roster clean (this is a backup account that I use mainly when jabber.org goes down or when I can't handle the conversational load of the ~2300 people in my jabber.org roster).</p>
<p>Congratulations to the Prosody team on a solid piece of software!</p>

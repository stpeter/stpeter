    <p>I've started going for a swim on the way home from work on Friday evenings whenever possible. The Denver Department of Parks and Recreation maintains a number of swimming pools, one of which is located downtown not far from the offices of Jabber Inc. Not many folks seem to use the pool around 5 o'clock on a Friday afternoon, but I've found it's a great way to unwind at the end of the week.</p>

<p>John Robb has written <a href="http://jrobb.userland.com/stories/2002/05/17/theNewEconomy.html">an essay</a> on the new economy. You do remember the new economy, don't you? Well, Robb argues that it's alive and well, just that it's taking a form that people and pundits hadn't expected. Specifically, technological innovation is putting large corporations under severe pressure while small companies and individuals are thriving (not surprising, since innovation favors the small and nimble). My favorite quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>What most of us care about is the ability to think, create, and enjoy.  The new economy makes that better, easier, and smoother for more people than ever.  Say goodbye to the tarriffs from the tolltakers of corporate America.  We won't miss them.</p></blockquote>

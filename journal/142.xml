<p>Surfing around the website of the Libertarian Party of Colorado, I came across this <a href="http://www.lpcolorado.org/cl/2001/11nolan.html">interview</a> with LP founder David Nolan. He has an interested theory, which I saw him give a speech about on C-SPAN once, regarding the cycles of American political history and the probability that we'll witness a political and cultural sea-change in 2004 or thereabouts. In fact <a href="http://www.co-freedom.com/2001/09/nolan.html">he thinks</a> that the events of September 11th make such a radical change more, not less, likely &mdash; and he argues that, unfortunately, the change will likely be in an authoritarian or fascistic direction, not in the direction of freedom.</p>

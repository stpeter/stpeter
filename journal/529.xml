    <p>The President of the United States of America held a fundraiser last night less than a mile from where I live. I was reminded of a line from Walt Whitman's <cite>Song of Myself:</cite></p>
    <blockquote>
<p>Have you outstript the rest? Are you the President?<br/>
It is a trifle, they will more than arrive there every one, and still pass on.</p>

    <p>Although I <a href="891.html">prefer to sign</a> my electronic communications with a digital signature, I also value anonymity when I surf the web (and I'm <a href="http://tor.eff.org/overview.html.en">not the only one</a>). In the past I've sporadically used services like Anonymizer, but recently I discovered something better: <a href="http://tor.eff.org/">Tor</a>. Tor grew out of Navy research on <a href="http://www.onion-router.net/">onion routing</a> (though it <a href="http://www.onion-router.net/Publications/tor-design.pdf">now uses</a> incremental path-building) and, based on my research so far, I think it's a pretty solid approach to anonymous browsing. It does slow down the web experience, but then I'm not particularly in a big hurry.</p>

<p>Yum, I just found <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/beastly.html">this page</a> containing a big list of collective nouns for animals. Reminded me of a <a href="/poems/problem.html">poem</a> I wrote along those lines once. But really I was looking for Latin-derived <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/beastly.html#Adjectives">adjectives</a> for various animals. You know canine and feline and bovine and equine, but do you know lupine and taurine and ursine and porcine? I do, but until now I didn't know anguine and ranine and lapine and murine. Words are fun. :)</p>

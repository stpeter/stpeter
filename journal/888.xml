    <p>This weekend, <a href="http://www.pgmillard.com/blog/">Peter Millard</a> updated the <a href="http://status.jabber.org/">jabber.org server</a> to run <a href="http://ejabberd.jabber.ru/">ejabberd</a> instead of our old hodgepodge of various different software packages. It seems we still have some kinks to work out, but overall it's working well so far. Expect Peter to report more fully soon regarding the migration experience.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the ejabberd team for the software, and to Peter for his diligence in making the switch a reality!</p>

<p>The Internet is in trouble. In fact, the Internet as we knew and loved it is dead and gone. I gave a talk about that in July at <a href='http://triconf.com/'>TriConf</a> in Richland, Washington. Thanks to the folks at <a href='http://www.jkprovideo.com/'>JK Productions</a>, you can now watch the talk for free <a href='http://vimeo.com/105204206'>on Vimeo</a>.</p>

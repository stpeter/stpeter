    <p>"Any sufficiently advanced society is indistinguishable from magic." What do I mean by that?</p>
    <p>When Arthur C. Clarke formulated his third law of technology, I'd bet he mainly had in mind the usual whiz-bang gadgets and life-changing innovations.

So would our softer technologies: contracts (how can you trust people to hold up their end of the bargain?), savings banks (are you sure they won't just keep your valuable stuff and not give it back?), humane societies (are you serious that people spend all that time and money to save mere dogs?), and thousands of other activities and institutions. Perhaps the seemingly effortless magic of America and other Western societies is what attracts immigrants and imitators the world over.</p>

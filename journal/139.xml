<p>I found two older articles by Zia Sardar that are quite good, one pointing out that <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,552800,00.html">terrorism is anti-Islam</a> and another describing his <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/islam/story/0,1442,576698,00.html">fatwa on the fanatics</a>. I notice he has written a book on Islam entitled <em>Introducing Muhammad</em>, which through the wonders of information technology I've just reserved at the Denver Public Library.</p>

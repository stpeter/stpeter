<p>The folks who run the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/about/doing_business/open_source/index.html">Open at Cisco</a> site have published a brief <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/about/doing_business/open_source/stories/jabber.html">article</a> I wrote about how Jabber Inc. has supported open standards, open source, and open communication over the years. I'm excited to be part of the Cisco team, which is deeply committed to <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/about/doing_business/open_source/standards.html">open standards</a> through its work with the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a>, <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home.htm">ISO</a>, <a href="http://www.itu.int/">ITU</a>, and now the <a href="http://xmpp.org/">XSF</a>. :)</p>

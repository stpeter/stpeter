<p>Now here's a movement I can get behind: <a href="http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle2008/tle485-20080921-03.html">the 50-state secession</a>. Radical decentralization has got to be a big part of any solution to what ails America, and busting up the country into its 50 constituent states would be a step in the right direction (as would pushing state powers down to the county level, county powers down to the municipal level, municipal powers down to the neighborhood level, neighborhood powers down the street level, etc.). Dump D.C.!</p>

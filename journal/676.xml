    <p>Two well-known commentators retired recently. The first was a traditional journalist: William Safire of the New York Times. The second was one of the most prominent bloggers: Andrew Sullivan. In one of his farewell columns (temproarily <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/24/opinion/24safire2.html">here</a>, but you know that NYT policy of quickly archiving things), Safire quoted James Watson (co-discoverer of the biological double helix) and Bruce Barton (an old-school advertising executive) as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"Never retire. Your brain needs exercise or it will atrophy."</p>
      <p>"When you're through changing, you're through."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>For his part, Andrew Sullivan provided the following words of wisdom in his <a href="http://www.andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2005_01_30_dish_archive.html#110723289508671920">farewell blog entry</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I've always thought it's a good idea to quit something after around five years or so. Before it becomes a chore. Before you become numb.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Combine these sentiments and the result is a career philosophy that encourages one to endlessly and restlessly explore new opportunities, not rest on one's laurels. Personally I've always experienced that five-year itch &mdash; it's one reason I didn't get a Ph.D. (I'd burned out on higher education after 4 years of college), why I moved into web application development in 1996, and why I got heavily involved with Jabber in 2000. Astute readers will note that I've devoted the last five years of my life to Jabber. Whether I will stay true to form regarding the five-year itch remains to be seen. ;-)</p>

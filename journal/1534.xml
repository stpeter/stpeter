<entry>
<p>As previously mentioned, the <a href='1527.html'>internationalization odyssey</a> I completed with <a href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7564/'>RFC 7564</a> got its start innocently enough through the need to modernize the handling of Jabber IDs (as I recall, Alexey Melnikov, applications area director at the time, made me promise that I'd correct the internationalization of JIDs at the IETF before he would sign off on <a href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6120/'>RFC 6120</a>, the core spec for XMPP). Now, all these years later, those corrections are finally done in the form of <a href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7622/'>RFC 7622</a>. Well, <em>that</em> only took a bit over 5 years!.</p>

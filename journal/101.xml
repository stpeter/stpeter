<p>Well I think I'm going to resurrect this site as a way to test out Dizzy's Jabber-to-Blog component. We're mainly posting nowadays to <a href="http://jabnews.manilasites.com/">JabNews</a> as well as to <a href="http://jogger.jabber.org/">Jogger</a> over on jabber.org, but I figure since a search for 'stpeter' yields this site as the second hit, I might as well use it. :)</p>

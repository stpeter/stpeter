<p>For those of you who like to mainline your epistemology rather than receive it diluted in the form of RDF and XML schema and such, I've just posted an <a href="/writings/rand/abelard.html">essay</a> of mine on conceptualism in the theory of knowledge. This paper was first published in <a href="http://www.aynrandstudies.com/">the Journal of Ayn Rand Studies</a> last fall, so I figured it was about time to post it on the web.</p>

<p>Composer <a href="http://www.monkey.org/~jefrey/">Jeffrey Lindon</a> has posted MP3 files of four of the piano pieces he wrote based on my <a href="/writings/fire/urban.html">urban haiku</a>. I like them a lot -- despite their classical form they've got some nice spiky rhythms and astringent harmonies. :) You can listen to them <a href="http://www.mp3.com/notabene/">here</a>.</p>

<p>My favorite site for comparing places in America is <a href="http://www.city-data.com/">city-data.com</a> (the forums are fun, too, though anecdotal). It seems that they recently posted a whole bunch of <a href="http://www.city-data.com/top2/toplists2.html">top 101 lists</a> for everything from <a href="http://www.city-data.com/top2/co8.html">Top 101 counties with the highest percentage of residents that keep firearms around their homes</a> to <a href="http://www.city-data.com/top2/co10.html">Top 101 counties with the highest percentage of residents that had a sunburn in the past 12 months</a>. (!) Those of a libertarian bent might want to stay away from the <a href="http://www.city-data.com/top2/c503.html">Top 101 cities with the biggest local government total salary and wages expenses per resident</a> and the <a href="http://www.city-data.com/top2/c502.html">Top 101 cities with the biggest property tax revenues per resident</a>. Have fun!</p>

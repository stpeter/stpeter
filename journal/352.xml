<p>Fast Company <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/69/google.html">searches</a> for the soul of Google. The results are five basic rules for success:</p>
<ol>
<li>The User Is in Charge.</li>
<li>The World Is Your R&amp;D Lab.</li>
<li>Failures Are Good. Good Failures Are Better.</li>
<li>Great People Can Manage Themselves.</li>
<li>If Users Come, So Will the Money.</li>
</ol>
<p>True story: Google is not spelled "googol" (as you might expect), so I once emailed the good folks at Google wondering if they realized that their company name can be parsed as "go ogle". They replied that nothing is accidental. :-)</p>

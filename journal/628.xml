    <p>Reading about the success of the private sector in Somalia reminded me of the <a href="http://www.trickleup.org/">Trickle Up Program</a>, a charitable organization dedicated to helping the poorest of the poor by providing seed capital and business training so that such people can start their own micro-businesses. Somehow I lost track of them, but I think I'll start donating again, since they play a unique role in fostering self-sufficiency worldwide.</p>

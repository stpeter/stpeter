<p>After attending an academic gathering recently, I got to thinking about why I generally don't like university professors. It's not just that most of them have an ego the size of Canada, think they're morally and intellectually superior to us mere professionals, and have political views somewhere to the left of Fidel Castro. No, I realized it's because they are so insulated from the market yet so disdainful of the very market economy that makes it possible for them to have their cozy little existence safely ensconced within the groves of academe. Heck, even the free-market professors I respect tend to teach at large, government-run institutions of higher learning &mdash; it's not as if they are educational entrepreneurs out there exposing themselves to market forces by starting small, innovative, or for-profit schools.</p>

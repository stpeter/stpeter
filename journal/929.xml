    <p>Joe Hildebrand has <a href="http://arch.jabber.com/archives/2006/04/000146.html">posted</a> some information about the memorial service for Peter Millard, which will take place on Wednesday, May 3, 2006 at 7:30 PM, at the <a href="http://www.broomfieldumc.org/">Broomfield United Methodist Church</a> in Broomfield, Colorado.</p>
    <p>Peter's family has requested that, in lieu of flowers, donations be made in Peter's name to the following charities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="http://www.coloradocancercenters.com/rmcc_foundation_tmpl.cfm?categoryid=11&amp;pagename=34">RMCC Foundation</a> (1683 Red Poppy Drive, Suite 100, Brighton, CO 80601 USA)</li>
      <li>The <a href="http://www.bch.org/foundation/foundation.cfm/About%20the%20Foundation">Boulder Community Hospital Foundation</a> (P.O. Box 9019, Boulder, CO 80301 USA)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As <a href="http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/2006-04.html#2006-04-27T09:15">promised</a>, I am still thinking about ways to help Peter's wife Christina and infant daughter Zoe more directly.</p>

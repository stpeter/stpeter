    <p>Wired magazine has published a <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.02/nuclear.html">great article</a> on why it's so important for us (specifically, the USA) to embrace nuclear power. I've been convinced of this since reading Petr Beckmann's book <cite>The Health Hazards of Not Going Nuclear</cite> some twenty years ago (even before I <a href="/writings/rand/eyes.html">taught English at a nuclear power plant</a> in Czechoslovakia), I've <a href="528.html">blogged about this before</a>, and I'll say it again: nuclear power is the safest, cleanest, most sustainable form of energy production known to man. Go nukes!</p>

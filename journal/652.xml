    <p>Daniel Drezner and Henry Farrell's article <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=2707">Web of Influence</a> is quite a comprehensive exploration of the blogosphere and its influence on real life. Unfortunately, the heading for the <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=2707&amp;page=5">penultimate section</a> is "blogo ergo sum" rather than "blogito ergo sum". Aside from the latter's Cartesian overtones and the fact that <a href="630.html">I coined</a> the phrase, a simple <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4ao2m">GoogleFight</a> shows that "blogito ergo sum" is the preferred form. Perhaps we'll need to have the keepers of <a href="http://www.economist.com/diversions/displayStory.cfm?story_id=2281926">Modern Latin</a> adjudicate this dispute... :-)</p>
    <p>(Update: Mr. Drezner reminds me that article titles and section headings are often written by the publication's editorial staff, so the target of my nit is properly not the authors in this instance. Mea culpa.)</p>

<p>While talking with my mom the other day, I came to realize that my cousin <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Merkel">Jim Merkel</a> runs an organization called the <a href="http://www.radicalsimplicity.org/">Global Living Project</a> and has published a book entitled <a href="http://isbn.nu/0865714738">Radical Simplicity</a>. His book is on the way to me from the Denver Public Library, so I'll be reading it soon.</p>
<p>Just another in a <a href="1216.html">continuing series</a> of <a href="1073.html">cousin updates</a>... :)</p>

<p>If you are reading this, I didn't have a chance to write a final entry to my online journal because I died unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Because all of my philosophical writings and musical compositions are in the public domain, they can be freely republished, recorded, etc. Unfortunately I have left some projects unfinished. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>The person who has published this last journal entry has been asked to modify some technical settings so that this website will in the future be located at <a href='http://stpeter.github.io/'>stpeter.github.io</a> (similarly for the Monadnock Valley Press, <cite>The Ism Book</cite>, and <cite>The Tao of Roark</cite>). Naturally, GitHub might go out of business. Nothing lasts forever. However, my repositories can be copied and republished by anyone who pleases.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading my musings for all these years!</p>

<p>Elisa and I will soon be moving to UP &mdash; no, not to Michigan's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan">Upper Peninsula</a>, but to Denver's <a href="http://www.homestore.com/Cities/Denver/UniversityParkGN.asp">University Park</a> neighborhood. Expect me to disappear for a week or so later this month as we move house about 2 miles south from our current location.</p>

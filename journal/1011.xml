    <p>One of the <a href="/music/covers.html">songs I cover</a> is an utterly obscure tune entitled "Freudian Complex Blues" by the psychedelic country band <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5069997">Surreal McCoys</a>, who were semi-active when I went to college in Manhattan in the late 80s. I heard the song only twice (at the Furnald Folk Fest on campus) so I'm not sure if I've got the words right, but the song is a kind of warped blues take on the Oedipus myth and it's really fun to perform. Now it turns out that Surreal McCoys frontman <a href="http://www.clubdemusique.com/clubdemusique/html/kevintrainor.html">Kevin Trainor</a> happens to live in my adopted hometown of Denver, Colorado. Maybe I could look him up and check those lyrics with him....</p>

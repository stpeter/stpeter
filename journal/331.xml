<p>While gallivanting around the East Coast recently, a thought came to me: why not create a Nietzsche reader, consisting of choice selections from the works of Nietzsche? I'd arrange it by topic and within each topic chronologically, so that one could get a sense of the evolution of Nietzsche's ideas. To really do it justice, I'd need to work my German into shape so I could make new translations. Sounds like fun. :)</p>

    <p>The third person I've assured for the <a href="http://www.cacert.org/">CAcert project</a> is the great <a href="https://www.jabber.org/people/linuxwolf.shtml">Matthew Miller</a>, author of the <a href="http://jso.jabberstudio.org/">JSO</a> code library for XMPP development in Java, member of the <a href="https://www.jabber.org/council/">Jabber Council</a>, and all around nice guy. One thing that's cool about CAcert is the ability to use your certificate for code-signing, which I'll bet Matt will use for JSO. So many reasons to get involved with CAcert. ;-)</p>

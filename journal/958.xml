    <p>I just updated <a href="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0174.html">JEP-0174: Link-Local Messaging</a>. This specification describes how to communicate in an XMPP-like fashion on local area networks, at WiFi hotspots, etc. -- all in a way that is interoperable with Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ichat/">iChat</a>. It's a cool feature since it enables you to chat with other people even if you don't have access to a public or private Jabber server, plus it's being added to more Jabber clients now that we have documentation for it. So go forth and implement! :-)</p>

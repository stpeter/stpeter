<p>Reason Magazine is running a <a href="http://www.reason.com/hod/cf050702.shtml">reasonable essay</a> on Pim Fortuyn by Charles Freund. Although written before the Dutch elections a few weeks ago, the essay provides a balanced assessment of Fortuyn's views and takes journalists to task for their simplistic representation of Fortuyn. Good reading.</p>

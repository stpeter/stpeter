<p>Because I spent most of my time in 2015 working at my day job and on the side researching the book I'm writing about Henry David Thoreau, I published very little in 2015 at the <a href='http://monadnock.net/'>Monadnock Valley Press</a> - really just <a href='http://monadnock.net/ibsen/a-dolls-house.html'>A Doll's House</a> by Henrik Ibsen and the <a href='http://monadnock.net/aurelius/meditations.html'>Meditations</a> by Marcus Aurelius. Here's hoping I can do better in 2016. We also earned only <a href='https://github.com/stpeter/monadnock/blob/master/FINANCE.txt'>$150.63</a>, a 50% drop from 2014. I'll need to talk to our director of sales and marketing about that... ;-)</p>

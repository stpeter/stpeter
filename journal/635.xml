    <p>So I'm driving around Denver this evening and in front of me there's this Subaru station wagon with a bunch of ladders on top and the license plate reads TRSTNHM but it isn't a Colorado plate, it's an <em>Israeli</em> plate (says "Israel" on the top and "Jerusalem" on the bottom), plus the license plate holder reads "Ambassador for the Kingdom". Hmm, a Jewish carpenter who "trusts in Him" and claims to be an ambassador for the Kingdom? I suppose this finally answers the question <a href="http://www.whatwouldjesusdrive.org/">"What would Jesus drive?"</a>... ;-)</p>

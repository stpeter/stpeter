<p>The latest issue of SuitWatch from <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/">Doc Searls</a> is incendiary. Literally. He writes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Markets are conversations</li>
<li>Conversation is fire</li>
<li>Marketing is arson</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, the SuitWatch list archive at <a href="http://www.ssc.com/pipermail/suitwatch/">http://www.ssc.com/pipermail/suitwatch/</a> is not working so I can't link to his article. Maybe I'll poke Doc about that. But by all means <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=NS-subscribe&amp;file=suitwatch">sign up</a> for SuitWatch -- it's well worth the reading!</p>

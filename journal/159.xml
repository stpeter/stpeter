<p>Looking at my Rand-McNally road atlas last night, it struck me how so many U.S. interstate highways go up to the Canadian border but not beyond. Why doesn't <a href="http://www.ihoz.com/I15.html">I-15</a> extend up to Calgary, <a href="http://www.ihoz.com/I29.html">I-29</a> to Winnipeg, <a href="http://www.ihoz.com/I95.html">I-95</a> to Fredricton? Is it fear of economic and cultural assimilation? Road envy? Or what?</p>

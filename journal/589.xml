    <p>At the prodding of someone I was chatting with the other day, I spent a bit of time reading up on <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> last night. It's quite fascinating! Erlang seems to be tailor-made for writing stable, robust servers. As the FAQ explains, "Erlang is a general-purpose programming language and runtime environment" and it "has built-in support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance" (the <a href="http://www.erlang.org/white_paper.html">whitepaper</a> provides more detail). It even includes something quite close to <a href="http://www.erlang.org/faq/x941.html#AEN1013">guaranteed delivery</a>. Sure, no one knows Erlang so it's probably hard for people working on open-source Erlang projects to find contributors, but given how hard it is to find contributors even when a project's chosen language is well-known, I'm not sure that using Erlang makes all that much of a difference. So there may be a good reason why <a href="http://ejabberd.jabberstudio.org/">ejabberd</a> gets such good reviews -- perhaps I need to look into it more seriously. (Heck, it might be easier for people to learn Erlang than to, say, port <a href="http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/1.4/">jabberd 1.4</a> to the <a href="http://apr.apache.org/">Apache Portable Runtime</a> or something like that.)</p>

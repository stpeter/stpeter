<p>Thanks to <a href="http://live.curry.com/">Adam Curry</a>, I've found an English-language version of <a href="http://www.pimfortuyn.nl/party.php?goto=english">Pim Fortuyn's platform</a> in the upcoming Dutch elections (no, my Dutch isn't good enough to read it all in my mother's language). The platform seems eminently reasonable to me, but then again I'm a libertarian. Probably it would strike others as horrifically radical. What I find interesting is that many countries in Europe are trending towards something like realistic or populist free-market policies. Denmark and Holland are two such countries &mdash; France is decidedly not (those who compare Fortuyn to Le Pen are wrong in a particularly loathsome fashion). Hartelijk bedankt, Mijnheer Curry!</p>

    <p>While writing the last entry, I was watching a baseball game between the Colorado Rockies and Atlanta Braves (after seeing the end of a game between the Yankees and Mariners). While searching for the Rockies game, I glimpsed a brief clip of Colorado Governor Bill Owens introducing some feature about the Rockies. Amusingly enough, Owens stated that the French historian Alexis de Tocqueville once observed that in order to understand America, you must understand baseball. Well, Tocqueville was a brilliant observer of American culture, but he died in 1859, well before baseball became the American pastime. Readers of this blog know that it was <a href="594.html">actually Jacques Barzun</a> who said "Whoever wants to know the heart and mind of America had better learn baseball." I think our esteemed Governor needs a bit of a history lesson. :-)</p>

<header><title>Link-Local Messaging Goes Wide-Area</title><date>2008-03-05</date></header>

<p>Stuart Cheshire recently pointed out to me that zero-configuration networking (in the Apple world, known as Bonjour) is not limited to local networks but can also work over <a href="http://www.dns-sd.org/#WA">wide-area networks</a>, which means it's possible to run a wide-area XMPP service using the protocol we used to call <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0174.html">link-local messaging</a> (just today the XMPP Council approved a revised version, which we now call serverless messaging). So I'm thinking it might be an interesting experiment to run such a service at xmpp.com, which is a spare domain we have lying around (right now it just redirects to xmpp.org). The DNS standards <a href="http://roderickmann.org/log/archives/2008/02/dns_standards_t.html">allow</a> this kind of setup, I've tested that our <a href="https://www.startssl.net/">DNS provider</a> enables it, and iChat <a href="http://www.dns-sd.org/iChatWideArea.html">supports wide-area communication</a>, so now I just need to figure out all the right <a href="http://www.dns-sd.org/ServerTestSetup.html">DNS bits</a> and <a href="http://www.dns-sd.org/ServerStaticSetup.html">server</a> <a href="http://www.dns-sd.org/ServerSetup.html">configurations</a>. There are a lot of options involved so it's good that someone has written a <a href="http://www.lettv.de/drupal/index.php?q=node/43">HOWTO</a>...</p>

<p>Reading a book on Matsuo Bashō has renewed my interest in ultra-short poems. The best-known form here is haiku, which in Japanese consists of three sections of 5, 7, and 5 syllables each. The most famous haiku is probably this one written by Bashō in 1686:</p>
<blockquote>furuike ya kawazu tobikomu mizu no oto</blockquote>
<p>It's often translated as something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
ancient pond<br/>
a frog jumps in<br/>
water's sound
</blockquote>
<p>Because English has many short words (compare "frog" to "kawazu" or "jumps in" to "tobikomu"), it's possible to write even more concise poems in English than in most other languages. Although I never thought I'd consider haiku to be wordy, compare a few 5-7-5 verses to a few 3-4-3 verses:</p>
<blockquote>
thundering waters<br/>
at this distance only seen<br/>
make a cooling mist
</blockquote>
<p>vs.</p>
<blockquote>
see the mist?<br/>
waters thunder<br/>
far away
</blockquote>
<p>Or:</p>
<blockquote>
cicadas buzzing<br/>
in well-watered cottonwoods<br/>
down in the ravine 
</blockquote>
<p>vs.</p>
<blockquote>
down below<br/>
cicadas buzz<br/>
in the trees
</blockquote>
<p>Or:</p>
<blockquote>
in this early snow<br/>
faded flowers of summer<br/>
plastered on the ground
</blockquote>
<p>vs.</p>
<blockquote>
early snow<br/>
summer blossoms<br/>
plastered ground
</blockquote>
<p>Or this one (appropriate for my collection of urban haiku):</p>
<blockquote>
a couple huddles<br/>
with a single umbrella<br/>
waiting for the bus
</blockquote>
<p>vs.</p>
<blockquote>
he and she<br/>
one umbrella<br/>
bus stop bench
</blockquote>
<p>I rather like the even more concise, evocative 3-4-3 format with its mere 10 syllables. I'm not sure if it has a name (most poets just call it a haiku), but "toku" is a possibility (I think that would be Japanese for "ten-verse", but I've never studied Japanese so I'm only guessing).</p>
<p>Oh, and mimicking Bashō here is a haiku on Henry David Thoreau:</p>
<blockquote>
Walden pond<br/>
Thoreau jumps in<br/>
water's sound
</blockquote>

<p>While travelling in Europe a few weeks ago, I thought of a book I'd like to write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don't Buy This Book, You Can Read It for Free on the Internet!</p>
<p>The Closing of the Copyright Era, the Open-Sourcing of the Book, and What it All Means for Readers, Writers, and Publishers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not that I'll have time to write it anytime soon...</p>

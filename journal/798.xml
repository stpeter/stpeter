    <p>I just completed my first pass through a total revision of <a href="http://www.ismbook.com/">The Ism Book</a>, the dictionary of philosophy I first wrote in 1990. I still need to fix up the XSLT transformations a bit and read the entire work again for accuracy and consistency, but it seems that I'll probably be posting version 4.0 in the very near future.</p>

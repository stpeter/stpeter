    <p><a href="http://jeremie.com/blog/">Jer</a> is <a href="http://jeremie.com/blog/index.php?entry=entry060325-131146">exploring</a> a concept he's calling <a href="http://www.microid.org/">MicroIDs</a>: "small, decentralized, verifiable identity". I think my blog may be the first site in the world to use the microid meta tag (view source to see), since I added it experimentally when Jer and I were chatting about this a few days ago. :-)</p>

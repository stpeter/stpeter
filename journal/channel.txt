<header><title>Simplicity</title><date>2011-12-07</date></header>
<entry>
<p>Six months ago or so I found myself <a href="1426.html">inspired</a> by reading Edward Tufte, as a result of which I <a href="1427.html">simplified</a> my blog. But it's still too busy. It needs to be much simpler &mdash; like <a href="http://inessential.com">inessential.com</a> by Brent Simmons, which is just gorgeous to me and looks fantastic on mobile devices. Brent uses <a href="http://inessential.com/2009/01/30/new_publishing_system_tour_of_my_head">custom (but unreleased) software</a>, so I might need to develop my own approach as well (something even simpler than the old system I ditched back in 2007). Simplify, simplify, simplify.</p>

<header><title>The Slow Arrow of Beauty</title><date>2011-12-07</date></header>
<entry>
<p>From Nietzsche's <cite>Human, All Too Human</cite>, Section 149 (translated by R.J. Hollingdale):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The noblest kind of beauty is not that which suddenly transports us, which makes a violent and intoxicating assault upon us (such beauty can easily excite disgust), but that which slowly infiltrates us, which we bear away with us almost without noticing and encounter again in dreams, but which finally, after having for long lain modestly in our heart, takes total possession of us, filling our eyes with tears and our heart with longing.</p>

<header><title>Political Flatland</title><date>2011-11-25</date></header>
<entry>
<p>Ever notice how American political discourse is becoming more and more two-dimensional? Left vs. Right. Liberals vs. Conservatives. Progressives vs. Capitalists. Tea Partiers vs. Occupiers. Et cetera.</p>
<p>Yet the real problems don't get solved, and those individuals who constitute government continue to abuse the power they hold for their own benefit and the benefit of their friends (a.k.a. cronyism). It doesn't particularly matter who gets elected, because the policies (and we have policies for everything nowadays!) don't change in their fundamentals.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>I've come to the conclusion that things don't change because that's how the politicians and their cronies and media supporters like it. Sure, they make a lot of noise about how divided Americans are. But that's because theirs is a strategy of divide and conquer. The more we normal folks think in terms of left vs. right, the less we'll think in terms of up vs. down &mdash; which is the true divide in America today.</p>
<p>It's like <a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/Flatland/">Flatland</a>: most Americans are bamboozled into believing the two-dimensional worldview of left vs. right so that they won't dare to look up at the elites who are in control.</p>
<p>And yes, I am, more than ever, <a href="833.html">politically homeless</a>&hellip;</p>

<p>My friend <a href="http://blog.dizzyd.com/">Dizzy</a> has a good idea: spend <a href="http://blog.dizzyd.com/blog/2010/10/16/10-minutes/">10 minutes reading and 10 minutes writing</a> every day. Not reading news websites or writing email messages, but spending quality time with the English language (or your language of choice). It's a fine idea, and I think I'll start today. :)</p>

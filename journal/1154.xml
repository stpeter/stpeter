<p>I like split infinitives. Consider: <em>to boldly go where no man has gone before</em> is so much more powerful than "boldly to go" or "to go boldly" (ick). For me the general rule is that it's best to place a modifier as close as possible to the term it modifies (as in <a href="468.html">only if</a>), and if you can prevent a "to" from getting between your adverb and your verb, more power to you! I realize that a preference for the split infinitive borders on grammatical heresy in some parts, but then again I like the word <a href="748.html">ain't</a>, too. :)</p>

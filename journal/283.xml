<p>I started to write a lengthy blog entry about a truly bizarre experience I had today out on the periphery of the <a href="https://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a> community. Then I remembered the sage advice that Friedrich Nietzsche gives in <cite>Also Sprach Zarathustra:</cite></p>
<blockquote><p>Where solitude ceases, the marketplace begins; and where the marketplace begins, the noise of the great actors and the buzzing of the poisonous flies begins.... Flee into your solitude! You have lived too close to the small and the miserable.... No longer raise your arm against them. Numberless are they, yet it is not your destiny to be a fly-swatter.</p></blockquote>

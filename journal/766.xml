    <p>To me, Jon Udell's post on <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/06/13.html#a1249">Wikipedia and the social construction of knowledge</a> points up some problems with the <em>centralized</em> construction of knowledge. Yes, <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/">Wikipedia</a> is cool, but attempting to build one true centralized repository of knowledge makes that repository a more desirable target for those who would manipulate your understanding of the world. Better, I think, to pursue a more decentralized approach &mdash; not one community of knowledge, but many communities of knowledge. After all, decentralization is the Internet way, no?</p>

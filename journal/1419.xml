<p>Some years ago I wrote a <a href="/music/yes/andyou.html">brief analysis</a> of the Yes song "And You and I" for someone who contacted me out of the blue over the Internet (perhaps he had read my journal entries about Yes from <a href="65.html">June 29, 2000</a> and <a href="87.html">April 16, 2001</a>, or my essay <a href="/writings/rand/rr.html">Saying Yes to Rand and Rock</a>). Sadly, he was dying of cancer at the time, but his wife told me that my letter meant a great deal to him because he too had puzzled over the song for many years. I've decided to post it online in case some other Yes fans might find it enlightening.</p>

    <p>Yesterday was Columbus Day, a source of much controversy (especially, it seems, in Denver). Jim Bennett <a href="http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20021012-110317-8770r">explains</a> why it would be better for North Americans to celebrate the voyages of the Italian <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~engels/discovery/cabot.html">John Cabot</a> than those of his fellow countryman Christopher Columbus. From now on I'll be celebrating June 24 (the day Cabot landed <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/journals/EH/EH33/croxto33.html">somewhere</a> in northeastern North America) rather than the second Monday in October.</p>

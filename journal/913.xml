    <p>I spent today attending the funeral of <a href="http://www.seangabb.co.uk/flcomm/flc144.htm">Chris Tame</a>. I never met Chris in person &mdash; we corresponded only by email over the years. He <a href="413.html">re-published</a> several of my essays at the <a href="http://www.libertarian.co.uk/">Libertarian Alliance</a> and encouraged me to write several new ones especially for LA, which I did in 2004 (<a href="http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/cultn/cultn052.htm">Ayn Rand and American Culture</a> and <a href="http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/histn/histn047.htm">Ayn Rand and the Ascent of Man</a>). I had always wanted to meet Chris if I ever got to London. This week I finally got to London but Chris was gone. May he rest in peace.</p>

<p>Last week, Stowe Boyd <a href="http://www.corante.com/getreal/archives/2005/02/03/social_circles.php">linked</a> to a cool application called <a href="http://www.marumushi.com/apps/socialcircles/">Social Circles</a>, which enables you to graph out the relationships between people on discussion lists based on how often they post, who replies to whom, etc. Unfortunately I don't see an easy way to feed in an existing list archive, but I've contacted <a href="http://marumushi.com/">Marcos Weskamp</a> about that since it would be fun to graph out a long-running list like <a href="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev/">JDEV</a>. It'd also be interesting to graph the list over time, since contributors come and go over the years.</p>

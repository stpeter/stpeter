    <p>Thanks to <a href="http://explorersfoundation.org/glyphery/139.html">Glyph #139</a> at the <a href="http://explorersfoundation.org/">Explorers Foundation</a>, I've found the work of the late <a href="http://www.isil.org/resources/fnn/2002nov/van-notten-obit.html">Michael van Notten</a>, who late in life became heavily involved in the stateless society of Somalia, specifically the northern area of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awdal">Awdal</a>, where he <a href="http://libertariannation.org/a/f62d1.html">worked</a> to set up a free port and other enterprises. His <a href="http://www.liberalia.com/htm/mvn_stateless_somalis.htm">essay</a> on the Somali experience makes for fascinating reading.</p>

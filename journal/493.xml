<p>Roderick Long <a href="http://praxeology.net/unblog02-04.htm#07">reflects</a> on the idea of individualist anarchism as a universalization of aristocracy. He quotes George Woodcock:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In reality the ideal of anarchism, far from being democracy carried to its logical end, is much nearer to aristocracy universalized and purified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or as Shelley said: "The man of virtuous soul commands not, nor obeys."</p>
<p>Roderick also quotes Ernest Lesigne on socialism vs. anarchism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both desire equality. One by lowering heads that are too high. The other by raising heads that are too low.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His long quote from Anne Rice's novel <cite>The Vampire Lestat</cite> is quite intriguing, too. (And he's got me quite interested in reading Oscar Wilde's <cite>The Soul of Man Under Socialism</cite>.)</p>
<p>Aristocracy for everybody!</p>

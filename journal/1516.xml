<p>For several years, my Twitter profile has identified me thus: "Technologist. Writer. Musician." Yet I've come to realize that I'm not a writer. Oh, I do write on occasion and I'm fairly good at it, but I don't write every day or even every week like real writers do.</p>
<p>Although I've become less comfortable with self-identifying as a writer, I've become more comfortable with self-identifying as a philosopher (in the sense of <a href='1432.html'>a seeker after wisdom</a>). Thinking and reflecting on my experience is something that I do every day, even if it sometimes takes years for those insights to appear in writing. So now it's: "Technologist. Musician. Philosopher."</p>

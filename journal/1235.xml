<p>I just updated <a href="http://monadnock.net/">monadnock.net</a> with a few more essays by <a href="http://monadnock.net/thoreau/">Henry David Thoreau</a>, and also changed the look and feel by borrowing the stylesheets designed by my old e-pal <a href="http://tess.oconnor.cx/">Tess O'Connor</a> for her online edition of <a href="http://federali.st/">The Federalist Papers</a>. In my ever so humble opinion, it looks really classy. :)</p>

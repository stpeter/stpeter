<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.clairewolfe.com/blog.html">Claire Wolfe</a>, I just discovered a blog called <a href="http://www.sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=19Mar03">The Picket Line</a>, consisting of a powerful argument (and practical strategies) for reducing one's income enough so that one no longer pays taxes to support the government of the American Union. Definitely in the grand tradition of Thoreau's <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/statecraft/civ.dis.html">Civil Disobedience</a>.</p>

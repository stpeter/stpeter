<p>When I have a book in my hand, I can usually be found reading all that heavy stuff like Nietzsche (just wait until I decide to re-read all of Aristotle!). So yesterday I took a little break and devoured two of my favorite books for young adults: <cite>The Wonderful O</cite> by James Thurber and <cite>The Phantom Tollbooth</cite> by Norton Juster. Both are highly recommended for kids from ages 10 to 100.</p>

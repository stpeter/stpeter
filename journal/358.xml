<p>Little-known fact: we owe our current crazy medical payment system to "temporary" wage-price controls during World War II (the crisis has passed, but the solutions linger on). Why in the world is medical insurance still tied to employment? It's ridiculous. You don't lose your home or auto insurance if your company goes out of business. We need to restore some sanity to medical care, and the folks at <a href="http://www.simplecare.com/">SimpleCare</a> are doing something about it: direct payment from patient to doctor. Makes perfect sense to me.</p>

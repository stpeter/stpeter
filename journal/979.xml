    <p>I recently had occasion to re-read Jacob Bronowski's little book <a href="http://isbn.nu/0060972815">Science and Human Values</a>, which contains a pleasant if somewhat dated dialogue entitled "The Abacus and the Rose". I've always rather enjoyed the sonnet with which Bronowski ends the dialogue:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
      I, having built a house, reject<br/>
      The feud of eye and intellect,<br/>
      And find in my experience proof,<br/>
      One pleasure runs from root to roof,<br/>
      One thrust along a streamline arches<br/>
      The sudden star, the budding larches.
      </p>
      <p>
      The force that makes the winter grow<br/>
      Its feathered hexagons of snow,<br/>
      And drives the bee to match at home,<br/>
      Their calculated honeycomb,<br/>
      Is abacus and rose combined.<br/>
      An icy sweetness fills my mind,
      </p>
      <p>
      A sense that under thing and wing,<br/>
      Lies, taut yet living, coiled, the spring.
      </p>

One such project will be an essay that chronicles his changing evaluation of Epicurus (from early enthusiasm in <cite>Human, All Too Human</cite> to disillusionment and disagreement starting, I think, at the end of <cite>The Gay Science</cite>). Another project will explore his influence on the Russian-American novelist-philosopher Ayn Rand &mdash; I originally thought of writing just one essay on this topic, but I've come to realize that any one essay will merely scratch the surface, and that a book-length study is needed here (I'm not sure whether I'll be the one to write that). Another possible project is, as I've mentioned before, a "Nietzsche Reader" that brings together a selection of his "aphorisms" and essays; this reader would best be organized by topic and within each topic chronologically, so that one can trace the history of his reflections on past thinkers (Socrates, Jesus, Epicurus, Voltaire), cultural periods (Classical Greece, the Renaissance), human pursuits (art, science, philosophy, religion), and areas of philosophy (ethics, politics, education, epistemology).</p>

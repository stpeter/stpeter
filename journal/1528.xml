<header><title>RFC 7565: Account URIs</title><date>2015-05-19</date></header>
<entry>
<p><a href='1527.html'>RFC 7564</a> is a good example of a necessarily complex piece of work that required a long time to produce. Yet sometimes even simple things take time. Case in point: the specification of the 'acct' URI scheme, also published today as <a href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7565/'>RFC 7565</a>. In June of 2012 I split the definition of this scheme out from the <a href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7033/'>WebFinger</a> document so that it could stand on its own. Indeed, the 'acct' URI spec was approved for publication almost 2 years ago, but couldn't be published as an RFC until the PRECIS framework was published today as RFC 7564. Ah, the wonderful world of technology standardization...</p>

<p>Don't ask me where I've found the time, but over the last six weeks I've posted a <a href="http://www.monadnock.net/chronology.html">whole raft</a> of public-domain texts over at the <a href="http://www.monadnock.net/">Monadnock Press</a> &mdash; writings by the likes of Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Horace, Peter Ab&#xE9;lard, John Locke, Victor Hugo, Edmond Rostand, Willa Cather, Mark Twain, H.L. Mencken, and Frederick Douglass (the first time that his speech <a href="http://www.monadnock.net/douglass/self-made-men.html">Self-Made Men</a> has been published on the Internet, as far as I know). Next I'll work to finish my translation of the <a href="http://www.monadnock.net/epicurus/vatican-sayings.html">Vatican Sayings</a> by <a href="http://www.monadnock.net/epicurus/">Epicurus</a>. Enjoy!</p>

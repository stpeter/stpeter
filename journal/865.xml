    <p>Over at <a href="http://cafehayek.typepad.com/">Cafe Hayek</a> (world's best tagline: "where orders emerge"), Russell Roberts is looking to find <a href="http://cafehayek.typepad.com/hayek/2006/02/folks_songs_for.html">folks songs for classical liberals</a>. Now that I've got a small recording setup at home, I really need to record some of my libertarian protest songs. :-)</p>

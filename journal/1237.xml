<p>Here in Colorado, Wash Park Prophet <a href="http://washparkprophet.blogspot.com/2008/06/global-warming-predictions.html">opines</a> about a new U.S. government report on climate change that reportedly has been "hailed for not ignoring mainstream science as previous reports did".</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but <a href="1077.html">science is not a matter of counting noses</a>, it is a matter of tracking reality. Therefore the term "mainstream science" is worse than oxymoronic -- it is simply moronic.</p>

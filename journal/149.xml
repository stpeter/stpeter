<p>In the last few days I've fixed up two more of my <a href="/writings/rand/">essays on Ayn Rand</a>: <a href="/writings/essays/deathoftaxes.html">The Death of Taxes</a> and <a href="/writings/rand/meaning.html">Objectivism and the Meaning of Life</a>. I'm now hoping I can finish, and perhaps even publish, this collection by the date of the Ayn Rand centenary (2005-02-02). Ah, the mental life of a recovering Randian. :-)</p>

<p>Over the last several weeks I've been working a bit on an essay for submission to the <a href="http://www.shelleconomistprize.com/">2003 Shell Economist Essay Contest</a>. This year's theme is the human relationship to our natural environment. What I've come up with so far is a dialogue between the Greek gods regarding whether or not to destroy the human race for its ecological sins. You can read what I've written so far <a href="/writings/essays/clubofgreece.html">here</a>. Personally I'm rather fond of it (the dialogue form is lots of fun), but feedback is always welcome.</p>

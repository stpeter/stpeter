    <p>I'm thinking about submitting a paper for the fourth <a href="http://www.ceas.cc/">Conference on Email and Anti-Spam</a> about instant messaging spam (a.k.a. "spim") on the Jabber network -- or, to be precise, the lack thereof. If you have experience with receiving (or even sending ;-) Jabber spam, I'd love to <a href="/contact.html">hear from you</a>.</p>

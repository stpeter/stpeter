    <p>Today's <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/08/24/238224">Slashdot story</a> finally spurred me to join the <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/">Distributed Proofreaders</a> project. Not that I have lots of time for it, but I hope to contribute in my spare moments (especially on books that have a bit of Latin and Greek in them). It's a worthy cause.</p>
    <p>BTW, it turns out that they use Jabber for a lot of their communications. In the main PGDP chatroom (pgdp@conference.jabber.org), pourlean (one of the project admins) reports that using Jabber has really helped their productivity. Perhaps a case study is in order&hellip;</p>

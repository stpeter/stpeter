    <p>Last night I gave a short presentation at the meeting of my local neighborhood association, the University Park Community Council. Fellow UP resident Henry Ammons and I have been working on a new website for our neighborhood, which we've unveiled at <a href="http://www.upcc.us/">http://www.upcc.us/</a>. We still have a lot of content to add, but we'll work to get much of it online in the next few weeks.</p>

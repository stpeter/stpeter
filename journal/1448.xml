<entry>
<p>This evening I broke out my jumbo Taylor six-string and played some Bob Dylan songs: <cite>The Times They Are A-Changin'</cite>, <cite>Honey Just Allow Me One More Chance</cite>, <cite>Corinna, Corinna</cite>, <cite>It's All Right Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)</cite>, and a few of my other <a href='755.html'>favorites</a>. I've long wanted to record a collection of Dylan songs, which I'd entitle "RAZ" (the initials of his given name, Robert Allen Zimmerman). Maybe I can work on that one after I finish my <a href='/music/yes/'>Squire Variations</a>&hellip;</p>

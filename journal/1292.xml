<p><a href="http://www.kismith.co.uk/wordpress/">Kevin</a>, <a href="https://el-tramo.be/">Remko</a>, and I just sent the manuscript for <cite>XMPP: The Definitive Guide</cite> to our editor at <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a>. Now it goes out to some technical reviewers, whose feedback we will incorporate in January while we prepare the final text. You can check out the <a href="https://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596157197/">Rough Cuts</a> now, or find it at your favorite bookseller come April. And remember: don't wait for the movie! ;-)</p>

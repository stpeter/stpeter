<p>Over the last few months I've seen a lot of out-of-state license plates in the Denver area. The preponderance seem to be from four of the most failed states in America: California, Oregon, Michigan, and Illinois (we'd probably see a bunch from New Jersey if it weren't so far to drive). You have to wonder if these folks will bring their voting proclivities with them; if so, expect economic policies in Colorado to further deteriorate over the next few years.</p>

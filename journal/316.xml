<p>Today I started working a bit on version 4.0 of <a href="http://www.ismbook.com/">The Ism Book</a>, my dictionary of philosophy. I re-converted the format back to DocBook XML and began the massive cleanup required to make the content something I can be proud of. I may even finish this by the end of the year. No promises, but at least I'm making progress. Stay tuned.</p>

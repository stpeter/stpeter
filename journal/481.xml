<p>Last night I put all my <a href="437.html">desert island books</a> on one shelf in my office. In fact I removed two because they didn't seem essential (Rand's <cite>Anthem</cite> and the poems of Horace). I'd have a harder time coming up with a really short list of music, though. Only ten CDs? Impossible! Certainly Bach's <cite>Goldberg Variations</cite>, <cite>Art of the Fugue</cite>, and <cite>Cello Suites</cite> would be on the list, as would Chopin's <cite>Nocturnes</cite> and Dvorak's <cite>Cypresses</cite>. Something from Duke Ellington would be essential, probably <cite>And His Mother Called Him Bill</cite> (which has a kind of elemental passion that some of his other recordings lack). I'd need some Yes -- <cite>Close to the Edge</cite> for sure and perhaps a self-made compilation of my favorite pieces from their other recordings. I find myself listening a lot to <cite>If I Could Be With You</cite> by Marcus Roberts -- it's a great compendium of jazz piano styles (from Joplin and James P. Johnson to Ellington and Monk) -- so I think I'd bring that to my desert island. Well, that's only nine. Maybe I <em>could</em> whittle it down to such a short list. But I'd still be missing Dylan, Aretha, Ella, and so many others...</p>

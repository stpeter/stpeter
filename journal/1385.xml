<p>Last night I got my first taste of the local specialty in Hiroshima: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okonomiyaki">okonomiyaki</a>. (Did I mention that I'm in Japan right now? :) The best I can describe it is that it's kind of like a noodle frittata or cabbage-stuffed pancake. You sit down at this huge griddle and they cook it up right in front of you, then you eat it there on edge of the griddle so it stays warm while you watch the cooks and sip your beer or sake. Outstanding. :)</p>

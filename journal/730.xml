<p>Rachel Carson, meet Adam Smith.</p>
<p>In honor of the recent celebration of <a href="http://www.earthsite.org/">Earth Day</a> (though it seems that Earth Day is <a href="http://www.themesh.com/abouted.html">actually</a> supposed to be celebrated on the vernal equinox), the Economist is running an <a href="http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3886849">article</a> and an <a href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3888006">editorial</a> about environmental economics, a.k.a. market-oriented environmentalism. I'm surprised that neither article mentions <a href="http://www.perc.org/">PERC</a>, the premier resource for information about improving environmental quality through markets.</p>

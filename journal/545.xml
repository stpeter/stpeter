    <p>While watching a bit of some <a href="http://www.yankees.com/">Yankees</a> game recently, I was struck by the announcer's saying something about supporting our soldiers around the world. The scary thing is, he was right: there are armed Americans stationed in well over a hundred nations. We have descended so far from the original American policy of "honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none" (<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/foleyx-browse?id=Alliances">Jefferson</a>), and we don't even know it! John R. MacArthur, publisher of Harper's Magazine, states it well: <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0504-15.htm">Drop the Perverse Wilsonianism and Get Out Now</a>.</p>

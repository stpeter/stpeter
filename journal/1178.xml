<p>Both <a href="http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2007/12/google-attacks.html">Stowe Boyd</a> and <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/12/14/Knol">Tim Bray</a> posted the other day about Google's new <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/12/encouraging-people-to-contribute.html">Knol</a> service and its threat to <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>. Both express concerns with Wikipedia that I've had for some time: the centralization, collectivization, and bureaucratization of knowledge. Furthermore, as <a href="http://chicagoboyz.net/archives/3729.html#comment-16654">Jim Bennett</a> pointed out a few years ago, the oft-drawn comparison between Linux and Wikipedia is not right, because Linux contains built-in correctives (the code must compile) and incentives (number of downloads etc.), whereas Wikipedia has neither of those things. I don't especially mean to dump on Wikipedia because I think it was a cool idea, but I find myself far more comfortable with a decentralized, individualized, libertarian model of knowledge, in which <a href="972.html">people on the edges</a> post what they know to their own websites and order emerges from the links that other folks naturally make to those sites. In other words, the Internet. :)</p>

<p>While out mowing the lawn today, the following question occurred to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can conceive of morality without God, why can you not conceive of society without government?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not an anarchist &mdash; yet &mdash; but I do think there is an interesting analogy here between faith and force.  The conventional view is that there can be no morality without god &mdash; that only faith can provide ethics with objective rules and limit individual behavior (recall Dostoevsky &mdash; "Without God, anything is possible").  Another conventional view is that there can be no society (only a Hobbesian state of nature) without government &mdash; that only a monopoly on the use of force can provide objective rules and limits to social behavior.  Is it possible that <em>both</em> conventional views are wrong?  Do not both views deny the power of self-ownership, self-responsibility, self-government?  Did Rand once again not go far enough by shutting out religion but leaving the door open even just a crack for government?  Something for me to think about.  I've never even considered anarchism.  I think it's time for me to do some reading on the subject &mdash; if I'm going to reject it, at least I want to know what I'm rejecting....</p>

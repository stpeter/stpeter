    <p>OK, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xbc-use-cases/#xmpp">this</a> is, I think, ill-advised. Compression of XMPP by means of binary XML?</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"You got your binary in my XMPP!"</p>
      <p>"You got your XMPP in my binary!"</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>However, unlike <a href="http://www.hersheys.com/products/details/reesespeanutbuttercups.asp">peanut butter and chocolate</a>, these are two great tastes that go horribly together. Something like, say, broccoli ice cream. Ick.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, this document is full of misunderstandings about the nature of <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> &mdash; the kinds of traffic it carries, the ability to scale XML streaming, and the like. I'll have to straighten some folks out on this score, because I sense a solution in search of a problem here&hellip;</p>

    <p><a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> (HT: <a href="http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2006/10/twitter_adds_im.html">Stowe Boyd</a>) is a relatively recent service that enables you to publish activity information to the web. They recently <a href="http://twitter.com/blog/2006/10/use-twitter-by-instant-message.html">added Jabber support</a> via a simple bot interface. It'd be cool if they integrated XMPP more deeply through support for, say, the <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0108.html">user activity</a> extension sent via <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0163.html">personal eventing</a>, but at least their little bot is a start. My Twitter page is <a href="http://twitter.com/stpeter">here</a>.  Unfortunately, it's really just yet another social networking silo -- or, as someone called it at a conference I attended recently, a "cylinder of excellence". :-)</p>

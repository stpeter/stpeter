<p>The current issue of the <a href="http://www.aynrandstudies.com/">Journal of Ayn Rand Studies</a> has hit the streets, including a short contribution by yours truly to a roundtable discussion of philosophical thinking on progressive rock (entitled "Saying Yes to Rand and Rock"). Come back in three or four months and I will have posted it online. (Isn't the future perfect just the greatest tense?) This issue also includes an essay by <a href="http://www.jilk.com/">Dave Jilk</a> on the nature of entities, which I'm looking forward to reading.</p>

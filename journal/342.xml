<p>I do apologize for all these political entries, but that's what is on my mind of late. I just posted the first draft of an essay entitled <a href="/writings/rand/guardrails.html">Of Guardrails and Gyroscopes</a>, in which I explore an analogy between gods and governments. It's something I've been thinking about for about 6 years, but I finally put some of it down on paper. Feedback welcome.</p>

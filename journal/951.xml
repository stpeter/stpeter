    <p>I've written a political protest song against eminent domain abuse but haven't recorded it yet (I hope to do so soon). Here are the words, to the tune of "This Land is Your Land":</p>
    <blockquote>
<p>
My land is your land, my land ain't my land<br/>
If you're connected and say you'll use it<br/>
To pay more taxes or please the planners<br/>
My land was made for you to steal
</p>
<p>
As I went walking out on that highway<br/>
I saw developers taking our property<br/>
I heard rapacious big corporations<br/>
Saying our land's for them to steal
</p>
<p>
My land is your land, my land ain't my land<br/>
If you're connected and say you'll use it<br/>
To pay more taxes or please the planners<br/>
My land was made for you to steal
</p>
<p>
In fair New London near old Fort Trumbull<br/>
There lived a woman named Susette Kelo<br/>
The politicians told her to vacate<br/>
They said your land's for us to steal
</p>
<p>
The politicians in fair New London<br/>
Weren't building bridges or schools or highways<br/>
They took that neighborhood to give to Pfizer<br/>
They said this land's for us to steal
</p>
<p>
My land is your land, my land ain't my land<br/>
If you're connected and say you'll use it<br/>
To pay more taxes or please the planners<br/>
My land was made for you to steal
</p>
<p>
The Constitution forbids all takings<br/>
Except for public use with compensation<br/>
But our Supreme Court said that's all bunkum<br/>
They said our land's for them to steal
</p>
<p>
My land is your land, my land ain't my land<br/>
If you're connected and say you'll use it<br/>
To pay more taxes or please the planners<br/>
My land was made for you to steal
</p>

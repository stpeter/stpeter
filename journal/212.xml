<p>It strikes me that the <a href="http://www.freestateproject.org/">Free State Project</a> is rather like gulching on a large scale. The term "gulching" was coined by Mary Lou Seymour and Claire Wolfe on the model of Galt's Gulch in Ayn Rand's novel <cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite>; they define it as "the act of building, or living within, low-profile communities of freedom seekers" (see their <a href="http://www.libertymls.com/gulch/what.html">gulching guide</a>). The FSP won't be exactly low-profile if it takes off, but it's definitely focused on building a state-wide community of people who are seeking freedom. Claire Wolfe's <a href="http://www.freestateproject.org/claire.htm">essay</a> on the FSP makes the same community connection, and it's touched on a bit at the end of this <a href="http://www.rationalreview.com/archive/stevetrinward/stevetrinward040102.html">article</a> by Steve Trinward (in the context of the Libertarian Party generally). I think community is an important element that's been missing in past and present efforts for liberty, so hopefully the FSP can address that imbalance.</p>

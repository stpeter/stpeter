<p>This weekend I wrote a review of <a href="http://www.objectivismstore.com/pc-277-1-the-literary-art-of-ayn-rand.aspx">The Literary Art of Ayn Rand</a> for <a href="http://www.aynrandstudies.com/">The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies</a>. I'm not sure when it will appear in print, but six months or so after that I'll add it to my online set of <a href="/writings/rand/">essays</a> on Ayn Rand and Objectivism.</p>

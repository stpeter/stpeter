<p>Following some leads mentioned in previous installments, I've been reading a bit more about the problem of universals in medieval philosophy. Most important, I've been delving into Ockham's attempt to cleanse Aristotelianism of Neo-Platonic, Augustinian, and Islamic influences. Fascinating stuff, at least as explained by E.A. Moody in his 1965 treatise <cite>The Logic of William of Ockham</cite>. As a result of these researches, I've added a bit about Ockham to my <a href="/writings/rand/aristotle-rand.html">essay</a> on Rand and Aristotle. I might need to write an entire essay on Ockham at some point, but I'll need to read a lot more before I do so.</p>

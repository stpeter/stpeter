<p>Wired has a <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/mit_pr.html">great article</a> about <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.html">OpenCourseWare</a>, a completely free website that provides course materials (handouts, video, quizzes, etc.) for numerous classes offered at MIT. Although most of the article focuses on 6.170 (Laboratory in Software Engineering), I note that the most popular course is 24.00: Problems of Philosophy. Yes, the eternal questions always beckon. :-)</p>

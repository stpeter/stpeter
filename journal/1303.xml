<p>This evening I finished my personal review of our text for <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596521271.do">XMPP: The Definitive Guide</a> (paralleling the work done by our official reviewers, which I haven't looked at yet). I can't wait to start working on the revisions, because I've found a bunch of ways to improve the text (especially in the early chapters, which have some holes that need to be filled). Onward and upward!</p>

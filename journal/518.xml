    <p>I think I may be back. Been doing a lot of travelling of late, both business and personal, including NYC (I think I blogged about that, no?), the D.C. area, Tucson (that was the fun part), and yesterday San Francisco. Plus I've been burning the candle on both ends in the <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a> world. So my blogging time has been less than minimal -- and when I've wanted to write, I've been working to finish my <a href="/writings/rand/">Rand essays</a>. But I hope to post more soon.</p>

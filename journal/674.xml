    <p>For fans of both Atlas Shrugged and the Narnian Chronicles, <a href="http://rebecca.hitherby.com/archives/000491.php">Aslan Shrugged</a> is way cool. As someone said in the comments:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"You got your Narnia in my Objectivism!"</p>
      <p>"You got your Objectivism in my Narnia!"</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Two great tastes that go great together! (Thanks to <a href="http://kenmacleod.blogspot.com/2005_02_01_kenmacleod_archive.html#110751601759512511">Ken MacLeod</a> for the pointer; and let's not forget that classic comic book <a href="http://www.comicsutra.com/cs/stripped/strippedv1i17.htm">Elvis Shrugged</a>!)</p>

    <p>Since my <a href="894.html">post</a> earlier today, I've been thinking about ways to improve my personal productivity. Here's one approach I've come up with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Devote the morning hours to my highest priority tasks for the day.</li>
      <li>Don't check email, read news, or log into IM until after lunch.</li>
      <li>At the end of each day, formulate a short list of priority tasks for the next morning.</li>
      <li>Lather, rinse, repeat.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I may try this next week.</p>

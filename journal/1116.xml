<p>I just added two neologisms to <a href="http://wordie.org/">Wordie</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wordie.org/words/tire%20mist">Tire mist</a> -- the mist that hits your windshield as you drive along the highway after a rainstorm, requiring you to use your windshield wipers even though it's not raining.</li>
<li><a href="http://wordie.org/words/tread%20pebble">Tread pebble</a> -- the annoying little stones that get stuck in the treads of your shoe soles and make a clicking sound as you walk along (also applies to tire treads).</li>
</ul>

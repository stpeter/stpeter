<p>I just posted (via email to the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/apps-discuss">apps-discuss@ietf.org list</a>) my <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/apps-discuss/current/msg01477.html">first report</a> about my activities as co-director of the IETF Applications Area. I was tempted to post it via blog, too, but I don't have time for reformatting the whole thing so you can <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/apps-discuss/current/msg01477.html">read it</a> in the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/apps-discuss/current/maillist.html">list archives</a>.</p>

    <p>I've always liked eggnog as a holiday treat, but the stuff they sell in the store is so processed (and overly sweet) that I never buy it, so this year I decided to make my own. The recipes I've seen tell you to separate the eggs, whip the egg whites and cream, and so on. But I'm too lazy to do that when all I want is a quick glass after dinner. After a bit of experimenting, I've settled on the following recipe, which I call "lazy man's eggnog":</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        1 egg<br/>
        Half a cup of half-and-half<br/>
        One-and-a-half teaspoons of sugar<br/>
        One-and-a-half tablespoons of brandy
      </p>
      <p>Place all ingredients in a blender or food processor and mix for 15 seconds or so.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Voila! One glass of eggnog. After pouring the resulting concoction into a glass, you may want to chill it in the fridge for 5 minutes before quaffing (I usually just chill the glass ahead of time, since I don't like to wait). You may also prefer more sugar &mdash; I don't like things sweet, so I tend to lay off the sugar, but I find that most people like things sweeter than I do.</p>

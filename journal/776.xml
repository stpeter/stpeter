    <p>I try not to pay much attention to political matters, but today's Supreme Court <a href="http://www.ij.org/private_property/connecticut/6_23_05pr.html">decision</a> in the case of <a href="http://www.ij.org/private_property/connecticut/index.html">Kelo v. New London</a> is tremendously depressing. As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor observed in her dissent, "The specter of condemnation hangs over all property. Nothing is to prevent the state from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory."</p>

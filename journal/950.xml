    <p>I just sent the following letter to Connecticut Governor Jodi Rell:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision last year in the case of Kelo v. the City of New London, Americans of all political persuasions have united against the abuse of eminent domain to evict people from their homes, many legislatures have taken serious steps at reform, and citizen-initiated referenda will be on the ballot this fall to modify state constitutions across the land. Yet Susette Kelo and her neighbors still face eviction by the City of New London! Today's <a href="http://www.courant.com/news/opinion/editorials/hc-evictionlooms.artmay30,0,2626575.story?coll=hc-headlines-editorials">editorial</a> in the Hartford Courant says it best, and I join them in urging you to intervene in this matter lest an even greater travesty of justice occur.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And I urge you to <a href="https://action.popuvox.com/default.aspx?actionID=268">contact Governor Rell</a>, too.</p>

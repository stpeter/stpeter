    <p>Two articles in <a href="https://www.wired.com/">Wired</a> today make me wonder how much longer people will be putting ink to paper:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,65813,00.html">Newspapers Should Really Worry</a> describes how people in the 18-to-34 cohort do a lot of reading, but they read things online, not in printed books, magazines, or newspapers.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,66031,00.html">The Library of Google</a> describes how Google is working with some major libraries and publishers to put massive numbers of books online.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'd say the writing is on the wall, but that sounds <em>so</em> second-millennium. ;-)</p>

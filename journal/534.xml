    <p>You remember that famous map of the counties won by Gore (Blue) and Bush (Red) in the 2000 presidential election. Mostly blue coasts, mostly red interior. Sophisticated, tolerant, but vaguely socialistic blues. Traditional, patriotic, but vaguely fascistic reds. The usual stereotypes.</p>
    <p>But not everyone fits in the red bucket or the blue bucket (after all, there are two kinds of people in the world: those who think there are two kinds of people in the world, and those who think there aren't). Me, I suspect I might be one of the <a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/052504B.html">purple people</a>: half red, half blue.

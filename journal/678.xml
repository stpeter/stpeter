<p>When experimenting with document publishing as I have been recently, the works I usually play with are my <a href="/writings/poems/">poems</a>, specifically the collection entitled <a href="/writings/fire/">Ancient Fire</a>. To my surprise, I discovered that back in 2003 I somehow accidentally deleted my "Urban Haiku", which I've <a href="/writings/fire/urban.html">just restored</a> using the magic of the <a href="http://www.waybackmachine.org/">Wayback Machine</a>. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Following up on last week's theme of Greek mythology, each of this week's words relates to one of the nine Muses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Terpsichorean &mdash; having to do with dance (from Terpsichore, the Muse of dance)</li>
<li>Thalian &mdash; comedic (from Thalia, the Muse of comedy)</li>
<li>Melpomenish &mdash; tragic (from Melpomene, the Muse of tragedy)</li>
<li>Euterpean &mdash; having to do with music (from Euterpe, the Muse of music and lyric poetry)</li>
<li>Uranian &mdash; astronomical (from Urania, the Muse of astronomy)</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems we don't have adjectives in English derived from Calliope (epic poetry), Clio (history), Erato (lyric or love poetry), or Polyhymnia (sacred poetry). Definitely something to muse on...</p>

<p>As noted the other day, I've been impressed with Shane McChesney's <a href="http://www.skippingdot.net/">Skipping Dot Net</a> site. He argues that <a href="http://www.skippingdot.net/2001/12/21">the best books are thin books</a>, and I must say I find his argument persuasive in my own life right now -- I'm too busy to read anything big and I need an author to focus on one topic and cover it well. Shane's thoughts are echoed <a href="http://www.flutterby.com/archives/viewentry.cgi?id=4393">here</a>, <a href="http://www.vivacapitalism.com/2001_12_23_archive.html#8138838">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.whump.com/moreLikeThis/link/02520">here</a>. The topic is of more than academic interest to me, since I'm under contract to write a book myself (about Jabber, of course). If you feel strongly about the length or focus of tech books, let me know!</p>

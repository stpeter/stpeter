<p>A while back I posted about <a href="1073.html">my cousin Ineke</a>, who has her own line of perfumes. Today my sister poked me about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_St._Andre">my cousin Jim</a>, who has his own Wikipedia page. Two famous cousins in one family! Granted, I have 72 first cousins, so the chances were pretty good. :)</p>

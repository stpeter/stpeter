<p>I just cleaned up the <a href="/writings/poems/">poetry pages</a> on this website. Much easier to navigate now. I'm still rather fond of these poems, which I wrote from 1994 through 2000. The last poem I wrote was <a href="/writings/fire/cobalt.html">Cobalt</a> on December 20th, 2000, and the muses haven't been back to visit since. That's not as bad as my songwriting activities, though: the last song I wrote was, I think, either <a href="/music/hagiography/topology.html">Topology</a> or <a href="/music/hagiography/pre-emptive.html">Pre-Emptive Strike</a> in 1995. Maybe I'll clean up my music pages next...</p>

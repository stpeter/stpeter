<p><a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/">Steve O'Grady</a> observes that <a href="http://www.conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/">OSCON</a> is <a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2008/07/29/oscon-is-people/">people</a>. And, naturally, beer:</p>

<p>From left to right that's Jack Erwin, Christopher Zorn, me, Justin Karneges (nearly invisible because of the glare), Ralph Meijer (with his trademark Hoegaarden), Joe Hildebrand, and SaraD (photo taken by Steve at <a href="http://www.kellsirish.com/portland/index.html">Kells</a>). Except I skipped the beer &mdash; I was sipping a fine Balvenie right around then, and having a long philosophical conversation with Chris and Justin about the meaning of <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a> and the future of <a href="http://psi-im.org/">Psi</a>. :)</p>

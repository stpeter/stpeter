    <p>I've just posted an essay of mine entitled <a href="/writings/rand/cna.html">The Conceptual Nature of Art</a>, which contains the fundamentals of my interpretation of Ayn Rand's philosophy of art. Although I originally submitted it to <a href="http://www.aynrandstudies.com/">The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies</a>, I've decided to remove it from consideration since the anonymous reader's comments requested a thorough overhaul and I simply can no longer muster the energy and enthusiasm to work that hard on <a href="/writings/rand/">interpreting Ayn Rand</a>. So I present it as-is, and in the <a href="http://www.saint-andre.com/me/copyright.html">public domain</a>. Enjoy!</p>

    <p>No, this blog does not have a comments feature.  There are several reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I prefer to receive comments over a spam-free communications technology (a.k.a. <a href="http://www.jabber.org">Jabber</a>).</li>
      <li>I already have enough dealings with one spam-infested medium (a.k.a. email) and I don't want to deal with another (a.k.a. blog spam).</li>
      <li>Everything at saint-andre.com is in the public domain. I have no idea if you want your comments to be in the public domain too, so to avoid any possible legal hassles I ask that you post your words somewhere else.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In short, it's not my job to provide an outlet for things you might want to say. If you want to say something in public, become a full <a href="844.html">citizen of the Internet</a> and run your own damn website.</p>
    <p>Yes, this is a harsh policy, but I'm not about to change it. Sorry. :-)</p>

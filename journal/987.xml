    <p>Last week I posted <a href="982.html">some Whiggish thoughts</a> about the prospects for freedom in America. It seems that Denverite David Aitken recently <a href="http://lifesbetterideas.blogspot.com/2006/07/lp-convention.html">participated</a> in the national convention of the <a href="https://www.lp.org/">Libertarian Party</a>, where as a member of the <a href="http://www.reformthelp.org//home/intro/">Libertarian Reform Caucus</a> he had a hand in producing the LP's new <a href="https://www.lp.org/issues/platform_all.shtml">platform</a>. Is there hope for the LP? I'm not yet sure, but I may take another look.</p>

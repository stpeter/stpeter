<p>The great language maven <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire">William Safire</a> died today. Despite the fact that he called himself a libertarian conservative, I never read much of his political commentary, preferring instead his writings on what Mencken called the American language. Indeed, as <a href="1147.html">previously mentioned</a>, a letter that I wrote to him circa 1982 was published in his book <cite>You Could Look It Up</cite>, so I was reading him at quite a young age!</p>

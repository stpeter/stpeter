<p>I've decided to start a translation of the extant writings of Epicurus, inspired most recently by some <a href="http://www.sunnimaravillosa.com/node/1347">thoughts on ataraxia</a> posted by <a href="http://www.sunnimaravillosa.com/blog/8">Manual Nunez</a> over at <a href="http://www.sunnimaravillosa.com/">Sunni Maravillosa's website</a>. But don't expect me to finish anytime soon, for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm ridiculously busy in <a href="https://xmpp.org/xsf/people/stpeter.shtml">my real job</a>, and will be for the foreseeable future.</li>
<li>I want to publish both an English translation and the original Greek, but I haven't been able to find the Greek text online anywhere, so I'm painstakingly typing it in character by character (with full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytonic_orthography">diacritics</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>But finish I shall, eventually. And naturally I will make the resulting text available in the public domain.</p>
<p>(So far all I've done is work on preliminary versions of the first few paragraphs of the <cite>Principal Doctrines</cite> -- you can find the work-in-progress <a href="http://monadnock.net/epicurus/principal-doctrines.html">here</a>.)</p>

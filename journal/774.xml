    <p>In one of the sessions at the <a href="http://www.ctcevents.com/conference/">CTC 2005</a> conference, Eugene Kim asked folks if they thought their company was especially good at collaboration. One person raised his hand -- a guy from Microsoft who said they were really focused on getting applications and people to work well together. What's hilarious is that this guy was an MBA intern who'd been with Microsoft for all of <em>four days</em>! How much Kool-Aid can you drink in four days? Or did they drop him in a vat of the stuff? Sheesh!</p>
    <p>Also overheard at CTC: someone who said their company is so conservative, it puts the "no" in innovation! :-)</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.feld.com/blog/">Brad Feld</a> links to the <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/">agile software development manifesto</a>, which reads in part:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.</li>
        <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation.</li>
        <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.</li>
        <li>Responding to change over following a plan.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Good principles.</p>

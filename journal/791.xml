<p>While I was away over the weekend, Dizzy <a href="http://www.dizzyd.com/blog/?p=57">unveiled Passel</a>, the open identity technology I've been <a href="736.html">hinting at</a> for the last few months. It's really Dizzy's baby, I just helped out with the <a href="http://www.passel.org/whitepaper.html">whitepaper</a> (which has a few consistencies and needs to be beefed up in a few areas &mdash; will do that this week). More on Passel soon.</p>

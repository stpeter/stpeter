    <p>I've been doing some reading on reputation systems. (I don't know that we want or need a reputation system in the <a href="https://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a> world, but I'm doing that reading as background to thinking through the question.) On the web we have things like <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/">XFN</a> to specify meta-data about links, but those do not explicitly provide appraisals of reputation. How does reputation emerge? PageRank and similar systems represent a kind of reputation. When I link to a page or a person or any other resource, is there a way to more explicitly tag the fact that I think that resource is valuable? I don't see quite such a mechanism in the semi-official <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page">microformats list</a> or in a quick survey of various blog posts on the subject (such as <a href="http://changelog.ca/log/2005/09/12/proposed-microformats-for-reputation-and-trust-metrics">this one</a>). How about rel-whuffie, folks?</p>

    <p>Arthur C. Clarke's Third Law of Technology states:</p>
    <blockquote><p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</p></blockquote>
    <p>As I realized at the <a href="http://www.libertyfund.org/">Liberty Fund</a> colloquium I attended in Tucson last weekend, I think there is a corollary:</p>
    <blockquote><p>Any sufficiently advanced <em>society</em> is indistinguishable from magic.</p></blockquote>
    <p>The explanation shall have to wait for when I have more bandwidth. One clue: the mechanisms of society (law, money, etc.) are, in essence, simply forms of technology.</p>

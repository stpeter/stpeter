<p>Early this morning I added an about page to this little weblog, including answers to those “who what where when why how” questions you’ve always wondered about but never dared to ask (yeah, right), plus some links thereto at the left of the page. It’s these incremental improvements that keep people coming back for more, I’m sure. ;-)</p>
<p>Actually I don't really give a hoot if people read this blog or not (I've never been into web counters and blogrolls and all that &mdash; but then again I'm very much not a competitive person). I get enough personal value out of this combination soapbox, sketchbook, and notepad that it doesn't much matter to me how many folks stop by or link to it. But since you're here, I hope you find it both edifying and entertaining. :-)</p>
<p>And now back to our regular blogging...</p>

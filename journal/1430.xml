<ul>
<li>"Phil Brown" by Dave Mallett</li>
<li>"Lowlands of Holland" by Steeleye Span</li>
<li>"&#xC1;guas de Mar&#xE7;o" by Elis Regina and Tom Jobim</li>
<li>"For You" by Judie Tzuke</li>
<li>"Tupelo Honey" by Van Morrison</li>
<li>"Love is the Only Goal" by Wendy Waldman</li>
<li>"Cockroach Cacophony" by Aztec Two-Step</li>
<li>"A Sailor's Life" by Fairport Convention</li>
<li>"She Moves Through the Fair" by Fairport Convention</li>
<li>"Hear Me Lord" by George Harrison</li>

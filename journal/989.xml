    <p>I'm currently reading the following books:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://isbn.nu/0465037712">Where Mathematics Comes From: How the Embodied Mind Brings Mathematics into Being</a> by George Lakoff and Rafael Nu&#xF1;ez</li>
      <li><a href="http://isbn.nu/1400042364">The Roads to Modernity: The British, French, and American Enlightenments</a> by Gertrude Himmelfarb</li>
      <li><a href="http://isbn.nu/0879759844">Why I Am Not a Muslim</a> by Ibn Warraq</li>
      <li><a href="http://isbn.nu/1573922471">Jihad in the West: Muslim Conquests from the 7th to the 21st Centuries</a> by Paul Fregosi</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The last two are pretty depressing, but I'll probably post about that 25 days from now.</p>

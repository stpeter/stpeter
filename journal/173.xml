<p>In my few spare moments of late, I've been making notes towards some more of my <a href="/writings/rand/">Rand essays</a>. The Rand centenary will occur on Feb. 2, 2005, and I'd really like to be done with all of my Rand-writing by then. Not that I've met such writing deadlines in the past, but one can hope. The essays I've touched most recently are <a href="/writings/rand/randianstyle.html">Rand's Descriptive Style</a>, <cite>Toward a Gnostic Objectivism</cite>, and <a href="/writings/rand/aso.html">Anarchy, State, and Objectivism</a>. I just requested <cite>The Gnostic Gospels</cite> by Elaine Pagels from the Denver Public Library, so I'll be re-reading that soon for further research into gnosticism. And how, you might ask, can such an esoteric religion provide a model for approaching a world-view as overtly secular as Objectivism? Hint: gnosticism was pro-individual, pro-woman, anti-hierarchy, anti-church. Besides, bringing up gnosticism allows me to talk about Blake, Whitman, and the medieval troubadours (the <a href="http://crusades.boisestate.edu/Albi/">Albigensian Crusades</a> not only put an effective end to troubadour culture but also wiped out the heretical Cathars, whose views seem to have been <a href="http://www.gnosis.org/library/cathtx.htm">heavily influenced</a> by gnostic teachings, as were the <a href="http://www.gnosis.org/library/manis.htm">Manichaeans</a> before them).</p>

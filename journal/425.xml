<p>Over at <a href="http://www.intellectualconservative.com/">IntellectualConservative.com</a> (whose site banner has pictures of Ayn Rand and William F. Buckley right next to each other &mdash; Ayn Rand must be rolling over in her grave!), I found <a href="http://www.intellectualconservative.com/article2635.html">this essay</a> about the state of America two years after 9/11. It's a bit breathless and vitriolic for my taste, but one sentence really struck me: "The war to save civilization is being lost on the home front." Sad but true.</p>

    <p>Finally, I have recorded some my own <a href="/music/">music</a>. Most of the music I've written was composed ten or even fifteen years ago (!), and I've been promising people that I would record it for just about that long. Last summer I <a href="564.html">bought a Mac</a> largely to make recording easier than it probably would have been on Linux, and for Christmas I got a basic Audio-Technica microphone. So I started messing around with GarageBand and quickly realized that my guitar skills have atrophied disastrously! After a few weeks of practicing, I got one tune in shape: a short and simple solo guitar piece entitled "Wordless Joy". It's really not much more than a semi-jazzy classical guitar ditty, but tonight I recorded a fairly clean rendition, so I've posted the <a href="/music/hagiography/wordlessjoy.mp3">mp3 file</a> online. Enjoy!</p>

    <p>Back when I worked as an editor, I used to be especially hardnosed about what I like to call "nothing words", such as "very", "really", "just", and "actually". These words add nothing to a sentence and are mere filler. Consider the difference:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Very few people really understand just how worthless these words actually are.</p>
      <p>vs.</p>
      <p>Few people understand how worthless these words are.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I find it hard to remove these nothing words from my speech because that's how people talk nowadays, but I've been working to ruthlessly remove them from my writing.</p>

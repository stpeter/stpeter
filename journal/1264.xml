<p>Barack Obama claims to be an agent of change (perhaps even the Prime Mover of political progress in America). Yet in his first substantive decision of the campaign, he chose Joe Biden as his running mate -- a career politician and consummate D.C. insider who has spent more than half his life as a Senator from Delaware. I don't know about you, but to me the words "Biden" and "change" just don't go together (unless the phrase is something like "Delaware needs a change of Senators, and Biden needs to go").</p>

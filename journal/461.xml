<p>The other day, I received an email from <a href="http://www.pierrelemieux.org/">Pierre Lemieux</a>, whose essay <a href="http://www.pierrelemieux.org/artfrance.html">Of French Caryatids and American Rednecks</a> I continue to admire, and who recently added me to his <a href="http://www.pierrelemieux.org/SiteFrames/fs-friends.html">links page</a>. From his links page I found again the website of <a href="http://fare.tunes.org/">Fran&amp;#xE7;ois-Ren&amp;#xE9; Rideau</a> (a.k.a. Far&amp;#xE9;), with whom I corresponded a number of years ago about <a href="http://www.tunes.org/">TUNES</a> (a project for a free, reflective computing system). It turns out that Far&amp;#xE9; has written some powerful essays on topics such as <a href="http://fare.tunes.org/articles/patents.html">the absurdity of patents</a> and <a href="http://fare.tunes.org/liberty/microsoft_monopoly.html">a libertarian view on Microsoft</a>. His thoughts on intellectual property (he calls it "information protectionism") are quite congruent with my evolved perspective. One of these days I'll write a manifesto on the importance of the public domain to creative individuals...</p>

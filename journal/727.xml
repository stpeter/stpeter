<p>Last week I had an interesting Jabber chat with <a href="http://eliot.landrum.cx/">Eliot Landrum</a> about homeschooling, triggered by <a href="http://www.reason.com/0504/fe.gb.homeschooling.shtml">this article</a> in Reason magazine. Eliot told me that many longtime homeschoolers are becoming disillusioned with the whole movement because lots of folks are no longer actively teaching their kids at home but instead driving their kids around from one tutorial to another. While I have nothing against that model, it does seem quite a stretch to call it homeschooling, so I coined the word "marketschooling" during our conversation (less charitable folks might call it "shuttleschooling"). Eliot's mom tended more toward <a href="http://www.naturalchild.com/guest/earl_stevens.html">unschooling</a>, which <a href="451.html">appeals to me</a> as well. Why teach your kids at home or shuttle them from place to place if you're just going to test them, grade them, and otherwise prepare them for standardized tests just like the public schools do?</p>

<p>I had dinner and lots of good conversation last night with fellow <a href="http://www.anglosphereinstitute.org/">Anglosphere</a> enthusiasts <a href="http://www.bangjafwac.com/roller/page/chuston">Chris Huston</a> (whom I first met at a meeting of the <a href="http://www.denverjug.org/index.jsp">Denver Java Users Group</a>) and Leif Smith of the <a href="http://www.explorersfoundation.org/">Explorers Foundation</a> (who it seems has just added a <a href="http://www.explorersfoundation.org/glyphery/179.html">link</a> to my essay on Zamyatin and Rand). As much as I live my life online, it's good to meet people IRL sometimes. I suppose that more and more I'm becoming "amphibious", as <a href="http://www.anglospherechallenge.com/about.html">Jim Bennett</a> calls it: dividing my time between the real world and the online world. It's a trend that will only gain strength in the coming years.</p>

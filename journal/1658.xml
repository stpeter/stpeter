<entry>
<p>Apparently I got out of the habit of writing a brief "annual report" for the Monadnock Valley Press, under whose auspices I both post public-domain texts (at monadnock.net) and publish the philosophy books I write on the side. So it's about time to remedy the oversight, since the last report was for 2016.</p>
<p>It turns out that 2020 was a good year for my public-domain postings. As catalogued in the publishing chronology linked below, I republished public-domain works by Lord Acton, Louisa May Alcott, Lord Byron, John Donne, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Benjamin Franklin, Robert Frost, Langston Hughes, Henrik Ibsen, John Stuart Mill, Michel de Montaigne, Thomas Paine, Edwin Arlington Robinson, Edmond Rostand, Arthur Schopenhauer, Philip Sidney, Sophocles, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Chidiock Tichborne, Voltaire, George Washington, and Yevgeny Zamyatin. That was much more than I expected; perhaps this activity was a pleasant distraction from all the turmoil in 2020. My publication roadmap for 2021 is not nearly so full, but perhaps I'll post more than I currently envision.</p>
<p>A quick look at sales reveals that I earned a whopping $375 on my books this year, which I'm sure was far offset by research and development expenses, i.e., all the scholarly books I bought in preparation for writing an epitome of Aristotle's ethics. C'est la vie.</p>

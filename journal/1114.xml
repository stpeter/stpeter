<p>I'm opposed to perpetual copyright. Since it seems that our congresscritters will perpetually extend copyright terms in response to lobbying by the likes of Disney and Warner Brothers, I respond by placing my works into the public domain. The Founders, too, were opposed to perpetual copyright, which is why the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Act_of_1790">Copyright Act of 1790</a> limits copyright terms to 14 years (with an optional 14-year renewal). According to some recent research, the Founders were preternaturally wise, since it seems that 14 years is the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070712-research-optimal-copyright-term-is-14-years.html">optimal copyright term</a>. But don't expect our congresscritters to return our copyright laws (or any other laws) to early-American norms anytime soon.</p>

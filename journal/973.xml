    <p>Today I've exchanged a few emails with <a href="http://www.gumption.org/skinner.htm">Brian Skinner</a> of the <a href="http://www.openrecord.org/about.html">OpenRecord</a> project, which puts all its code into the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">public domain</a>. Good for them! I promised Brian that I would finish my essay-in-progress entitled <a href='/writings/essays/publicdomain.html'>Who's Afraid of the Public Domain?</a> so I really must get to work on that...</p>

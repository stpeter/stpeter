<p>In honor of <a href="http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Oct2001/Family.asp">All Hallow's Even</a> (or the <a href="http://www.watchman.org/occult/samhain.htm">festival of Samhain</a> if you prefer the holiday's pagan roots), this week all of our words describe various state of darkness:</p>
<ul>
<li>crepuscular -- of twilight or half light (applies to both dusk and dawn)</li>
<li>Cimmerian -- characterized by perpetual mist and darkness (derived from a mythical people named the Kimmerioi mentioned in Homer)</li>
<li>nubilous -- cloudy, misty, foggy</li>
<li>tenebrous -- dark and gloomy</li>
<li>umbrageous -- shady</li>
</ul>
<p>That's not even to mention words like caliginous (dark and gloomy), fuscous (dusky), fuliginous (sooty), and atramentous (inky black). There sure are a lot of words for darkness in the English language!</p>

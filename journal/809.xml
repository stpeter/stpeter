    <p>On Saturday afternoon it was about 85 degrees in Denver. Then the temperature plummetted about 50 degrees in 36 hours or so. Since midnight last night it's been snowing (though without much accumulation, as you can imagine). I just started up one of my favorite recordings for snowy weather: <cite>Side by Side</cite> from Duke Ellington and Johnny Hodges. It's funny how certain kinds of music go with certain kinds of weather. Plus this is a great recording. I especially love the Duke's piano solo on "Stompy Jones" and the powerful, heavily chromatic chords he ends with. Bam!</p>

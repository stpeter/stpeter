<p>From Nietzsche's <cite>Human, All Too Human</cite>, Section 149 (translated by R.J. Hollingdale):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The noblest kind of beauty is not that which suddenly transports us, which makes a violent and intoxicating assault upon us (such beauty can easily excite disgust), but that which slowly infiltrates us, which we bear away with us almost without noticing and encounter again in dreams, but which finally, after having for long lain modestly in our heart, takes total possession of us, filling our eyes with tears and our heart with longing.</p>

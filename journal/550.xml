    <p>Joe Hildebrand recently <a href="http://arch.jabber.com/archives/2004/06/000105.html">linked</a> to a <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">fascinating discussion</a> of the so-called Dunbar number governing the ideal size of cooperative groups (in fact there seem to be multiple numbers, or a range of numbers). One of these days I must re-read it and blog about it, but for now I merely provide the link.</p>

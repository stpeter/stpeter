<p>My young friend Mike Szczerban has turned me onto Paul Graham, author of books on Lisp and some damn engrossing articles on topics technical and otherwise. The following are all worth reading:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html">Taste for Makers</a> (on the objectivity and importance of beauty in everything from painting to programming)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/road.html">The Other Road Ahead</a> (on the advantages of server-based, especially web-based, software)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">Being Popular</a> (on what makes a programming language good, popular, or both)</li>
</ul>
<p>Good reading.</p>

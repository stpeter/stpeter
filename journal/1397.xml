<p>On Friday I learned that the Internet Engineering Task Force's <a href="https://wiki.tools.ietf.org/group/nomcom/09/">NomCom</a> has <a href="https://www.ietf.org/ibin/c5i?mid=6&amp;rid=49&amp;gid=0&amp;k1=934&amp;k2=7484&amp;tid=1266193265">selected me</a> to serve a two-year term as Area Director (with Alexey Melnikov) of the <a href="http://www.apps.ietf.org/">Applications Area</a>, beginning at IETF 77 in Anaheim this March. Being selected as Apps AD (and thereby a member of the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/iesg/">IESG</a>) is a great honor, and I shall endeavor to live up to the highest principles of the IETF while serving. Here's to <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tao.html">rough consensus and running code</a>!</p>

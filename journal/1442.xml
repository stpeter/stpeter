<p>Six months ago or so I found myself <a href="1426.html">inspired</a> by reading Edward Tufte, as a result of which I <a href="1427.html">simplified</a> my blog. But it's still too busy. It needs to be much simpler &mdash; like <a href="http://inessential.com">inessential.com</a> by Brent Simmons, which is just gorgeous to me and looks fantastic on mobile devices. Brent uses <a href="http://inessential.com/2009/01/30/new_publishing_system_tour_of_my_head">custom (but unreleased) software</a>, so I might need to develop my own approach as well (something even simpler than the old system I ditched back in 2007). Simplify, simplify, simplify.</p>

<p>It appears that <a href="http://www.ronpaul2008.com/">Ron Paul</a> is <a href="http://www.freemarketnews.com/WorldNews.asp?nid=43192">raising lots of money</a> in his bid for the Republican nomination in '08. Is his small-government message resonating with American voters? As someone who is mostly libertarian (or at least not a simplistic libertarian), I wouldn't complain.</p>
<p>But I sure hope people aren't sending him money because of his knowledge of foreign policy, specifically regarding the causes of the 9/11 atrocities. No, Ron, the jihadists didn't attack us because we have meddled in the Middle East -- they attacked us because that's what the jihadists have done since the days when Mohammed lived in Medina. Perhaps I'll point Representative Paul to my essay <a href="/writings/essays/islam.html">Islam and the Future of Civilization</a> for some background reading...</p>

    <p>I forgot to mention recently that an essay of mine entitled "Image and Integration in Ayn Rand's Descriptive Style" was published in the Spring 2006 issue of <a href="http://www.aynrandstudies.com/jars/index.asp">The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies</a>. Expect me to post it online in three months or so.</p>

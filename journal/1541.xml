<p>The internationalization odyssey that started with <a href='1527.html'>RFC 7564</a> (the PRECIS framework) and continued with <a href='1533.html'>RFC 7613</a> (PRECIS handling of usernames and passwords) with a side tour into <a href='1534.html'>RFC 7622</a> (updated internationalization for XMPP addresses) continued today with the publication of <a href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7700/'>RFC 7700</a> (PRECIS handling of nicknames and display names for people, devices, accounts, websites, and other entities.</p>
<p>With publication of this document, we've completed our work in the PRECIS working group. Well, sort of - we've discovered some relatively small bugs in RFC 7564 and RFC 7613 so we'll need to go back and fix those. But at least we're receiving implementation feedback!</p>

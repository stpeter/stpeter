<p>The results of the <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/summit/summit5.shtml">XMPP Summit</a> a few weeks ago continue to leak out. I've been so busy with action items that I haven't had time to blog about it all, but I did want to note that over the last few days we've worked out the remaining details about how to use <a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> to access protected resources over <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/">XMPP</a>. Read all about it in the latest version of <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0235.html">XEP-0235</a>. Special thanks to Ralph Meijer and Blaine Cook for setting me straight about a number of issues on the <a href="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/social">social@xmpp.org</a> discussion list.</p>

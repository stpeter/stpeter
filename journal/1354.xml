<p>I've posted a new essay at my non-blog website, entitled <a href="/writings/essays/storm.html">The Gathering Storm</a>. Building on some recent weblog posts, it describes practical steps one can take right now to help bring about a free society, or at least prepare for the troubles that might transpire in these interesting times. Feedback is welcome as always.</p>

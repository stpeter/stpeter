<p>It's amusing how a simple typo can send you scurrying for the <a href="http://www.oed.com/">OED</a>. In a post about the intellectual history of the Enlightenment, <a href="http://www.dianahsieh.com/blog/">Diana Hsieh</a> writes of the "philosophical cannon". Now there's a concept! The OED notes that "the spellings <em>canon</em> and <em>cannon</em> occur side by side down nearly to 1800, though the latter is the more frequent after circa 1660". Both 'canon' and 'cannon' derive ultimately from the Greek &amp;#x3BA;&amp;#x3B1;&amp;#x3BD;&amp;#x3BD;&amp;#x3B1; meaning "a reed". Yet the terms diverged early on, with &amp;#x3BA;&amp;#x3B1;&amp;#x3BD;&amp;#x3C9;&amp;#x3BD; meaning "a straight [and presumably solid] rod" as well as "a rule" used by carpenters, whereas 'cannon' derives from the hollow side of the reed/rod family (Italian <em>cannone</em> is a large tube or barrel). Nietzsche once claimed to be philosophizing with a hammer, but to philosophize with a cannon is really to bring out the big guns!</p>
<p>That line from Nietzsche is often interpreted in a nihilistic sense, with "hammer" understood to be a sledgehammer (something one step short of a philosophical cannon, as it were). Yet the full quote from the preface to <cite>Twilight of the Idols</cite> reveals a lighter touch:</p>
<blockquote><p>This essay too -- the title betrays it -- is above all a recreation, a spot of sunshine, a leap sideways into the idleness of a psychologist. Perhaps a new war, too? And are new idols sounded out? This essay is a great declaration of war; and regarding the sounding out of idols, this time they are not just idols of the age, but eternal idols, which are here touched with a hammer as with a tuning fork: there are altogether no older, no more convinced, no more puffed-up idols -- and none more hollow.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nietzsche's talk about idols hearkens back to <a href="http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/b/bacon.htm">Francis Bacon</a> and his discussion of the Four Idols in <cite>The New Organon</cite> (an &amp;#x3BF;&amp;#x3C1;&amp;#x3B3;&amp;#x3B1;&amp;#x3BD;&amp;#x3BF;&amp;#x3BD; is a man-made tool, which is why our current sense of "organic" is diametrically opposite from the term's root meaning!). Interestingly, the English meaning of idol as the image of a false god (extended by Bacon to mean a dogma) was the final sense of the Greek &amp;#x3B5;&amp;#x3B9;&amp;#x3B4;&amp;#x3BF;&amp;#x3BB;&amp;#x3C9;&amp;#x3BD; to develop historically -- the term originally meant an appearance or phantom, later on an image (as in a mirror), then a mental image or idea (as in Plato's "Theory of Ideas"), then a mimetic likeness as in a statue or "graven image". In English we retain the same root notion of vacuity in the word "idle".</p>
<p>And a dogma is just idle words: it is what one believes or holds to be true ('tenet' comes from the Latin <em>tenere</em> meaning "to hold") -- usually a philosophical belief, and not always one that is justified (for Bacon a philosophical dogma was <em>prima facie</em> suspect, since it was not derived from nature but from the self-spun web of human ideas and language). Because <em>karma</em> is a Sanskrit term that means "action", when we say "my karma ran over my dogma" we essentially mean that actions speak louder than words. Tenets, anyone?</p>

<p>While in Prague I caught the tail end of a TV show about Anton&#xED;n Dvo&#x159;&#xE1;k's time in America. Dvo&#x159;&#xE1;k was fascinated with American folk music (Negro spirituals, etc.) and worked tirelessly to encourage his students to develop from such sources a native art music. His students are virtually unknown today, but the students of his students include Duke Ellington, James P. Johnson, George Gershwin, and Aaron Copland. You can find a bit of the story <a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/~humiowa/petera1.htm">here</a>. A topic for further reading, I think.</p>

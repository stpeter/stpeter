<p>Last Friday night I saw <a href="http://www.timobrien.net/">Tim O'Brien</a> in concert at <a href="http://www.swallowhill.com/">Swallow Hill</a>, and the previous Saturday I saw his sister <a href="http://www.mollieobrien.com/">Mollie</a> in Evergreen (CO) at a concert sponsored by <a href="http://www.hilltopmusic.com/">Hilltop Music</a>. Tim, a veteran of legendary bluegrass band <a href="http://www.hotrize.com/">Hot Rize</a>, is simply one of the best acoustic musicians on the planet, and Mollie is a singer of incredible presence who continues to impress me in a wide range of styles, from folk and blues to R&amp;B and jazz. Memorable concerts both. If you ever get the chance to hear either Tim or Mollie live, I highly recommend you do so!</p>

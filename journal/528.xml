    <p>James Lovelock, author of the Gaia Hypothesis, is so worried about global warming that he has <a href="http://argument.independent.co.uk/commentators/story.jsp?story=524230">come out in favor of nuclear power</a>. Personally I think the evidence for global warming is anecdotal at best, and I doubt that we puny humans would be the cause of it anyway (the earth experienced many drastic swings of warming and cooling way before humans ever evolved, let alone before they went industrial). But it's quite amusing to see so-called "environmentalists" from Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, and other advocacy organizations fall over themselves in the rush to condemn Lovelock's apostasy. I must admit that over time I've grown a bit suspicious of the nuclear power industry simply because it is just as dependent on government subsidies as the rest of the energy companies, but at least it's not killing 15,000 Americans a year like the coal industry is (at least according to the Harvard School of Public Health). Come to think of it, perhaps that's what the environmentalists want, since many of them are also in favor of negative population growth (though that will arrive naturally enough in 2040 or so if current U.N. projections are correct, which I doubt since the U.N. doesn't really know what it's talking about and tends to err on the side of population growth; perhaps 2030 is more likely).</p>

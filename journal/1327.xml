<p>I've decided that my favorite jazz guitar album is <cite>Virtuoso #3</cite> by Joe Pass. All the pieces were written by Pass, and they exude a wondrous economy of notes. With song titles like "Sevenths", "Ninths", "Dissonance #1", "Dissonance #2", "Offbeat", and "Minor Detail", many of these tunes border on etudes for jazz guitar, but more in the fashion of watercolor sketches or the <em>apuntes</em> of <a href="/writings/essays/sorolla.html">Joaquin Sorolla</a> than, say, Chopin's etudes for pianoforte. In line with some of my <a href="1275.html">recent musings</a>, there is a sparse absolutism to much of the music here, which I find quite appealing. The song I like best on this album is his eponymous tribute to Paco de Lucia. Extremely fine music!</p>

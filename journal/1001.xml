    <p>In yesterday's Rocky Mountain News, Tawfik Hamid <a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/opinion/article/0,1299,DRMN_38_5048866,00.html">spoke out</a> against jihadism. He'll do so in person tomorrow night at the <a href="http://www.du.edu/">University of Denver</a> and I plan to attend his talk. Reading his essay has also prodded me to post my <a href="992.html">blog entry</a> from September 10th as a standalone essay entitled <a href="/writings/essays/islam.html">Islam and the Future of Civilization</a>.</p>

    <p>John Hospers, professor emeritus of philosophy at UCLA and the first presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party, has apparently <a href="http://americanbacklash.com/">committed intellectual suicide</a> by urging those of a libertarian persuasion to vote for George W. Bush. Hospers, once a clear-thinking philosopher with strong Objectivist tendencies, has accepted several key myths promulgated by anti-intellectual American nationalists and therefore has abdicated completely the field of ideas; among those myths:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>This election is a turning point in American history, "an important electoral crossroads for the future of liberty", a fulcrum on which turns the very fate of Western civilization.</li>
      <li>A vast left-wing conspiracy is poised to take over America and foment an international leftist revolution as soon as a Democrat is elected to the presidency.</li>
      <li>Creeping socialism is such a clear and present danger that we must sacrifice our liberties and assent to creeping fascism in order to protect the American way of life.</li>
      <li>American patriotism requires continuous war, relentless intervention in foreign nations, and the building of an American empire rather than peaceful trade with all and entangling alliances with none.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Services are planned for November 2, 2004. Hospers is survived by reason and freedom, which outlast all fair-weather friends. In lieu of flowers, well-wishers are encouraged to redouble their commitment to clear thinking and the principles of liberty.</p>

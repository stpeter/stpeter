<p>Back in 1997 I started publishing a webzine entitled the <a href="http://review.monadnock.net/">Monadnock Review</a>. I stopped publishing the review in 2002, but I've long wanted to again do something productive with the <a href="http://www.monadnock.net/">monadnock.net</a> domain. In the last few weeks I've done just that by starting to republish public-domain texts there (&#xE0; la my old idea of a <a href="707.html">public domain press</a>). So far I've republished three texts: <a href="http://www.monadnock.net/rand/anthem.html">Anthem</a> by Ayn Rand, <a href="http://www.monadnock.net/thoreau/civil-disobedience.html">Civil Disobedience</a> by Henry David Thoreau, and <a href="http://www.monadnock.net/nietzsche/the-antichrist.html">The Antichrist</a> by Friedrich Nietzsche. I'll be publishing many more public-domain texts as I find the time to do so.</p>

<p>I'm happy to say that Cisco has <a href="http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2008/corp_110308.html">completed its acquisition</a> of Jabber, Inc. My start date at Webb Interactive Services (original parent of Jabber, Inc.) was November 1, 1999, and my start date at Cisco was October 31, 2008. Just a day shy of 9 years! I'm looking forward to many more years of working on Jabber, XMPP, and real-time communication.</p>
<p>For auld lange syne I figured I'd post a photo of the lobby sign at the Jabber Inc. offices. :)</p>

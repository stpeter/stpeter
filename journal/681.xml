<p>Over lunch with <a href="http://www.pgmillard.com/blog/">pgm</a> I mentioned my old friend Andy Barrows, with whom I studied at the long-defunct American Renaissance School before he went off to MIT and then Stanford (that's him on the left in <a href="http://waas.stanford.edu/alaska/andy.jpg">this image</a> of some flight testing over Alaska). Now it seems that Andy is CEO of <a href="http://www.nav3d.com/">Nav3D</a>, a company that produces synthetic vision systems which integrate GPS data with 3D graphics, thus enabling people (e.g., pilots) to visualize scenes in real time. Kinda cool.</p>

    <p>NewsForge <a href="http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=06/10/19/1517207">reports</a> on <a href="https://openliterature.net/shakespeare/">Open Shakespeare</a>, whose objective is to provide the complete works of Shakespeare in a completely open form. Wait, you ask, isn't all of Shakespeare in the public domain given that he wrote his plays and poems around 400 years ago? Well, not necessarily. The Bard certainly <em>deserves</em> to be <a href="https://opendefinition.org/">open knowledge</a> and the <a href="https://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> is working to make it happen. Kudos!</p>

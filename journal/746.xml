    <p>Congratulations to the <a href="http://www.ij.org/">Institute for Justice</a> and its clients on their <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,67537,00.html">victory</a> in the case of <a href="http://www.ij.org/economic_liberty/ny_wine/index.html">Swedenburg v. Kelly</a> -- the U.S. Supreme Court agreed that allowing direct sale of wines by in-state wineries but restricting such sale by out-of-state wineries was a violation of the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution. Keep up the good work, IJ!</p>

<p>I don't watch CNN nor do I visit cnn.com for my news. But now I know that I definitely will not be doing so, because CNN has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/10/16/ret.binladen.questions/">submitted questions</a> to be answered by Osama bin Laden. To interview someone is to think that they are open to persuasion and reason, that they are within the sphere of civilized discourse. Bin Laden and his organization have demonstrated (both in their terrorist activities outside Afghanistan and in their subjugation of the Afghan people) that they are outside that sphere, indeed that they seek to destroy it. The people who run CNN have now demonstrated that they have no understanding of the crucial issue of today (and all days): civilization vs. barbarity, which is literally an issue of life vs. death. Will we next see Hanoi Jane morph into Kabul Jane and show her support for the Taliban? <em>Boycott CNN!</em></p>

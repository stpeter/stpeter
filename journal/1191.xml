<p><a href="http://sandefur.typepad.com/">Timothy Sandefur</a> just clued me in to the fact that today is the <a href="http://sandefur.typepad.com/freespace/2008/01/happy-100th-bir.html">100th anniversary</a> of the birth of <a href="http://www.drbronowski.com/">Jacob Bronowski</a>. I have long admired Bronowski for his intellectual honesty and fearless independence, and I highly recommend his works for anyone who is interested in philosophy, history, biology, psychology, the sciences, and the arts.</p>

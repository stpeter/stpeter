<p>Once you start a tradition, it's hard to stop &mdash; people have expectations! So this week I was shoehorned into creating another installment of "words of the week" on my whiteboard at work. This week's theme is words of strong emotion (well, except for Friday's word &mdash; needed something calm and peaceful after all that Sturm und Drang):</p>
<ul>
<li>ululate (v.) &mdash; to howl or wail, especially in lamentation</li>
<li>dolorous (adj.) &mdash; deeply sad or despondent</li>
<li>splenetic (adj.) &mdash; extremely angry</li>
<li>apoplectic (adj.) &mdash; ditto</li>
<li>ataraxia (n.) &mdash; mental and emotional tranquility</li>
</ul>

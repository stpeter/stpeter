    <p>Here's a fun idea (HT: <a href="http://lifesbetterideas.blogspot.com/2006/12/books.html">David Aitken</a>):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Grab the nearest book.</li>
      <li>Open the book to page 123.</li>
      <li>Find the fifth sentence.</li>
      <li>Post the text of the sentence in your journal...along with these instructions.</li>
      <li>Don't search around and look for the "coolest" book you can find. Do what's actually next to you.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I'd prefer it to be "the last book you've read", but in this case they are one and the same because I've just finished re-reading (parts of) <a href="http://isbn.nu/0195069056">Albion's Seed</a> by David Hackett Fischer. Page 123 is an illustration so I proceed to page 124, where the fifth sentence reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Every part of the religious ritual of Congregational New England was thus centered on the word of God &mdash; the design of the meetinghouse; the enforcement of Mosaic law; the structure of the sermon; the pattern of Puritan prayer; the form of psalmody.</p>

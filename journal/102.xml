<p>The events of the last few days have reminded me of something I'd long forgotten: there does exist pure evil in the world. My old teacher David Kelley states it well in this <a href="http://www.objectivistcenter.org/pubs/dk_assault_on_civilization.asp">article</a>.</p> <p>For inspiration in these dark times, a lot of folks have been sending around the abridged text of a radio editorial by Canadian journalist <a href="http://www.rcc.ryerson.ca/ccf/personal/hof/sincla_g.html">Gordon Sinclair</a>. There's a fascinating <a href="http://www.rcc.ryerson.ca/ccf/news/unique/american.html">story</a> behind this editorial: although the <a href="http://www.theblessingsofliberty.com/articles/article13.html">abridged version</a> going around may sound as if it was written just yesterday, in fact it was first broadcast on June 5, 1973! Nevertheless the <a href="http://www.rcc.ryerson.ca/ccf/news/unique/am_text.html">original text</a> still provides a good read.</p>

    <p>Paul Hoffman <a href="http://lookit.typepad.com/lookit/2006/03/rock_is_dead.html">posted</a> the text of an amusing bumper sticker he spotted, so I figured I'd recount a few of my favorites:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Congress Happens.</li>
      <li>Visualize Using Your Turn Signal.</li>
      <li>Gravity: It's Not Just A Good Idea, It's The Law.</li>
      <li>My Golden Retriever Is Smarter Than Your Honor Student.</li>
      <li>Clinton: The President Who Did It Between The Bushes.</li>
    </ul>

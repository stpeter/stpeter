<p>Yesterday I translated some passages from Aristotle's <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> for my essay <a href="/writings/rand/aristotle-rand.html">Our Man in Greece</a>, so I finally declare my book <a href="/writings/rand/">Randian Reflections</a> to be done. One of the essays (on Nietzsche and Rand) is still to be published in the <a href="http://www.aynrandstudies.com/">Journal of Ayn Rand Studies</a>, but the others are complete enough that I am going to leave them behind now. Perhaps if I ever print them in a paper volume I'll revisit them all (the political essays are especially weak, I feel), but that day will arrive some years in the future (if ever) and it's time to move on so that I can finish <a href="http://tao-of-roark.com/">The Tao of Roark</a> (originally begun <a href="44.html">ten years ago</a>) and my <a href="http://www.monadnock.net/epicurus/">Epicurus translations</a>. More about those in the coming months&hellip;</p>

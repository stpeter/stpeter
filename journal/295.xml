<p>I finally put together a reading list to keep track of all the books I want to explore, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edelman, G. &mdash; Neural Darwinism; The Remembered Present</li>
<li>Millikan, R. &mdash; Language, Thought, and Other Biological Categories</li>
<li>Pinker, S. &mdash; The Language Instinct; How the Mind Works</li>
<li>Plotkin, H. &mdash; Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge</li>
<li>Spencer, H. &mdash; The Principles of Ethics</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems to contain a preponderance of books on biology and epistemology right now. Once I get more time I'll be hitting inter-library loan pretty hard, I think. :)</p>

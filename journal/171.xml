<p>Regarding the idea of reclaiming the word 'liberal', here's a line I just heard in Bob Dylan's song <a href="http://bobdylan.com/songs/befree10.html">I Shall Be Free No. 10</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree<br/>
I want ev'rybody to be free<br/>
But if you think that I'll let Barry Goldwater<br/>
Move in next door and marry my daughter<br/>
You must think I'm crazy!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The complaint about Barry Goldwater was to be expected (this <em>was</em> 1964, after all), but the assumption is that a true liberal wants everyone to be free, which sounds rather libertarian to me. Yes, "I am a liberal". :-)</p>

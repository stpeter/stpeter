<p>Lee Dryburgh has <a href="http://www.ecommmedia.com/blog/2008/01/peter-saint-andre-on-presence.html">posted</a> the podcast we did about presence as the dial tone for Internet communications. We could have chatted for quite a while longer, but maybe we'll do that as a follow-up to the <a href="http://www.ecommmedia.com/">Emerging Communications Conference</a> (be there or be square!).</p>

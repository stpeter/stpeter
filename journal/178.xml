<p>Time to play guitar. I've been practicing my <a href="/music/aubade/">solo guitar pieces</a> quite a bit lately, in hopes of increasing my fluidity and improving my interpretation. Which reminds me that I need to print off the sheet music so that I can work through some of the hard parts, correct any errors in the scores, and add some fingering information here and there (I've got some crazy fingerings in some of my pieces, especially in my "Arctic Suite", where I put the thumb of the left hand to good use on the fretboard!).</p>

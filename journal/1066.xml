    <p>In his first book (<cite>Meditations on Quixote</cite>), Jos&#xE9; Ortega y Gasset writes as follows (as quoted in his essay "Preface for Germans"):</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Woe to the race that does not halt at the crossroads before continuing on its way, that does not make a question of its own selfhood: that does not feel the heroic need to explain its destiny, to inundate its historic mission with light!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It strikes me that the same applies to individuals (yes, I tend to individualize everything). So just I transformed the idea into a short (though, I think, not very good) poem:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Crossroads</p>
      <p>(after Jos&#xE9; Ortega y Gasset)</p>
      <p>
When you finally arrive at<br/>
&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The crossroads of your life<br/>
Do not plunge blindly on through, but <br/>
&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Stop: inquire deeply<br/>
Into yourself, come to know the <br/>
&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Meaning of your ideal, <br/>
Shine great light on your potential,<br/>
&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;And only then move on.
      </p>

    <p>Sam Ruby <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2005/05/20/OpenID">comments</a> on <a href="http://www.danga.com/openid/">OpenID</a>:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>"If you have a webserver, can add something like the following to your template, and either can run a CGI script or know somebody who can run one for you, then you are in."</li>
      <li>"This design is also explicitly not trying to compete with the "big boys".  In particular, it has no notion of trust."</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I fail to see how those are good things, since:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Not everyone has a webserver (for the most part only geeks are associated with URLs).</li>
      <li>An identity system without a trust model strikes me as close to useless.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The two points are not unconnected. If we're limiting the system to geeks and not trying to take on the big boys by appealing to <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/A/Aunt-Tillie.html">Aunt Tillie</a>, then we already have something of an implicit trust model, just as the Internet did before it was opened to commercial use -- it was rather difficult to get on the 'net in those days, so we could assume that most people using it were clueful and to be trusted (at least somewhat). Personally I think there are <a href="736.html">better approaches</a> to identity on the Internet, but they haven't been released yet. ;-)</p>

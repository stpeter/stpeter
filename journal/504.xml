<p>Last night, <a href="http://www.dianahsieh.com/">Diana Hsieh</a> spoke at a local Objectivist group regarding her <a href="http://www.dianahsieh.com/toc/statement.html">statement of disassociation</a> from <a href="http://www.objectivistcenter.org/">The Objectivist Center</a> (formerly the Institute for Objectivist Studies). Since I'm persona non grata at gatherings of this local group (that's another story) and since I prefer to spend my Saturday nights doing some good cooking and a little blogging rather than arguing about Ayn Rand, I didn't attend Diana's talk. But naturally I do have opinions in the matter. In fact, as one of my email correspondents pointed out, I've been expressing those opinions for quite a while now. Here are some relevant weblog and journal entries:</p>

<p>So I guess I declared my intellectual independence as long ago as 1995.</p>

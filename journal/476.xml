<p>The Bush administration talks about fighting terrorism for the sake of freedom, but their actions reveal their true intentions. See, for instance, <a href="http://amconmag.com/12_15_03/feature.html">Free-Speech Zone</a> by James Bovard (published, I note, in <a href="http://www.amconmag.com/">American Conservative</a> magazine). Disturbing.</p>
<p>Yes, I heard about this article on the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/libertariansfordean/">Libertarians for Dean</a> email list (not to be confused with the eponymous <a href="http://libertariansfordean.blogspot.com/">weblog</a>). But no, I am not a Dean supporter -- he is, after all, a politician. Unfortunately, it seems that our only hope right now is to vote the "American Socialist Party" (Democrats) into at least one of the House, Senate, or Presidency so that we can slow down the juggernaut of the "American Fascist Party" (Republicans). Sigh.</p>

    <p>So the <a href="http://www.rtd-denver.com/">local bus drivers</a> are on strike here in Denver (word has it they want wages on par with their colleagues in New York). Which got me to thinking: in just about any other profession, unhappy workers at one company would simply quit and go work for somebody else. The problem is, there is no "somebody else" in the public transport business, because it's a local monopoly. Here's a better way: take all the huge public buses off the streets and simply let private vans and other jitney services stop at the existing bus stops (or build new ones if they want). Let a thousand entrepreneurs compete for the rider's dollar and determine the best routes, best schedules, and best prices. Open competition: what a concept!</p>

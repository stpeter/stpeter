    <p>Since today is a company holiday at my employer, I finally found time to beef up the <a href="http://www.upcc.us/">website</a> of the University Park Community Council, which I <a href="864.html">started working on</a> about three weeks ago. The site now includes lots more information about development and transportation, as well as contact information for neighborhood committee chairs, elected representatives, and the like.</p>

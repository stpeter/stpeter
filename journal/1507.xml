<p>I'm still struggling mightily with finding my voice on this Nietzsche project - not trying to represent exactly what Nietzsche wrote (which is notoriously slippery anyway), but providing my perspective on his ideas in a way that does justice to what I see as the core truth in his texts. Plus huge questions are swirling in my head about whether I can pull this off philosophically and poetically!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I'm going to try. As my colleague <a href='https://adambrault.com/'>Adam Brault</a> says: "What the heck. Why not?" :-)</p>
<p>Over the weekend, I wrote the first draft of the first poem for <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite>. There's no guarantee it will survive my usual self-editing process, but here it is anyway...</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Eternal Recurrence</strong><br/><br/>
What if<br/>
I've lived this hour, this day, this life<br/>
Before<br/>
And I<br/>
Must live them yet again, not once<br/>
But more<br/>
And more,<br/>
Until every experience<br/>
Repeats,<br/>
Recurs,<br/>
And doubles back a million times<br/>
Or more.
<br/><br/>
A curse!<br/>
And yet if it must be, what if<br/>
I bless<br/>
This fact<br/>
As much as if it were my choice,<br/>
Not less.<br/>
The less<br/>
I treat necessity as fate<br/>
The more<br/>
I love<br/>
The life I live, and live the life<br/>
I bless.

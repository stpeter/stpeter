    <p>For the last day and a half I've been reading through email. I was getting dangerously close to 1000 messages in my inbox again and feeling overloaded. Now my inbox is utterly empty &mdash; that's right, zero messages. Following various suggestions about personal productivity found on the Net, my new regimen is this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dispatch all inbox emails immediately by deleting, replying (if brief), creating calendar events, or adding an item to my todo list.</li>
      <li>If an email generates a calendar event or a todo list item, move it to a dedicated email folder for the relevant project (don't leave it in the inbox!).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Next step: prioritizing my todo list items and getting to work. :-)</p>

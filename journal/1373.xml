<p>John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods, published a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204251404574342170072865070.html">fine essay</a> in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday about some private, voluntary alternatives to the health care reform proposals emerging from the swamps along the Potomac. Unsurprisingly, some fair-weather customers of Whole Foods are now <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=8322658&amp;page=1">threatening to boycott</a> the store. For myself, I must say that Mackey's stand against coercive, collectivist regulation of health care makes me more likely to shop at Whole Foods, not less. (Interestingly, Elisa and I typically shop both at Whole Foods and at Safeway, whose CEO Steven Burd also published a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124476804026308603.html">good article</a> in the Wall Street Journal a while back about how they are cutting health care costs through voluntary incentives, not government coercion. Who would've thought that the grocery business would be out in front on this issue?)</p>

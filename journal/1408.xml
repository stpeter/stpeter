<p>I forgot to mention that I recently posted another public-domain text over at the <a href="http://monadnock.net/">Monadnock Press</a>: Henry David Thoreau's essay <a href="http://monadnock.net/thoreau/walking.html">Walking</a>. I'm also slowly converting all of the Monadnock Press texts (and <a href="/writings/">the books I've written</a>) over to fully conformant XHTML 1.1 as the first step toward producing ebook versions for Kindle, Nook, etc. All in my copious spare time, naturally. :)</p>

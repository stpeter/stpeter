<p>Even people who love music probably prefer certain periods, instruments, genres, and the like. I try to have big ears, but I must say that I'm not particularly fond of the flute or most woodwinds (except perhaps the oboe). And I really don't like the triangle. For instance recently I was listening to Z &#x10D;esk&#xFD;ch luh&#x16F; a h&#xE1;j&#x16F; ("From Bohemia's Woods and Fields") by Bed&#x159;ich Smetana and the incessant sounding of the triangle nearly spoiled it for me. The same goes for some of the symphonic poems of Anton&#xED;n Dvo&#x159;&#xE1;k.</p>
<p> Just my musical pet peeve of the day...</p>

    <p>I just spent a few hours updating my <a href="/writings/rand/">essays on Ayn Rand</a> &mdash; mostly cosmetic changes and consistency checks (e.g., to make sure they are all properly labelled as in the public domain). One of these days I'll print them all out and edit them a bit, though I might wait until I finish my essay on Rand and Aristotle&hellip;</p>
    <p>Update: I've also removed all instances of "obviously", "certainly", "of course", and other such <a href="771.html">lazy phrases</a>, as well as all instances of "ought" and "should" (consistent with my essay <a href="/writings/rand/lgo.html">Letting Go of Ought</a>).</p>
    <p>Update #2: I've also removed all instances of "very", "really", "just", "actually", and other such <a href="849.html">nothing words</a>.</p>

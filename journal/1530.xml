<header><title>RFCs 7572 and 7573: SIP-XMPP Messaging</title><date>2015-06-10</date></header>
<entry>
<p>And the hits keep coming! Today two more of my RFCs were published through the <a href='https://www.ietf.org/'>Internet Engineering Task Force</a>, defining how SIP and XMPP can interoperate for one-to-one messaging: <a href='http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7572'>RFC 7572</a> covers single messages (also called "pager-mode" messaging in the SIP world), whereas <a href='http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7573'>RFC 7573</a> covers one-to-one chat sessions (a.k.a. "session-mode" messaging). These documents continue in the series started with <a href='1511.html'>RFCs 7247 and 7248</a> and have been in the works since early 2008, if you can believe it. I hate to brag, but it shows how much I care about interoperability that I've kept pushing these specs forward all this time. :-) There are two more documents still to be published in this series: one on <a href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-stox-groupchat/'>multi-party text chat rooms</a> and the other on <a href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-stox-media/'>voice and video call signaling</a>, so stay tuned for more RFCs in the relatively near future...</p>

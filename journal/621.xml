    <p>Thanks to a <a href="http://www.survivalarts.com/archives/001254.html">tip</a> from <a href="http://www.survivalarts.com/">Survival Arts</a>, I've just discovered that Jim Bennett's book on <a href="452.html">the Anglosphere</a> has been published. The <a href="http://www.anglospherechallenge.com/tablecont.html">table of contents</a> looks positively mouth-watering if you go in for civilizational history and large-scale but well-grounded speculation about the near future. I don't buy many books, but I may run out and purchase this one! (Bennett has also started an <a href="http://www.anglosphereinstitute.org/">Anglosphere Institute</a>, it seems.)</p>

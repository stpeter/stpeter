<p>Because I love dark chocolate and almonds, I decided to start making my own chocolate bark. Turns out it's very easy and also delicious. Here's how I do it.</p>
<p>There are only three ingredients: 1 lb dark chocolate (I buy 4 oz bars of 72% dark chocolate at the supermarket), 1 cup of whole raw almonds, and a few pinches of sea salt. (Although I prefer almonds, you can also use pumpkin seeds or cashews or anything else that suits your fancy.)</p>
<p>Step one is to temper the chocolate. Break 3/4 of the chocolate (i.e., 3 of the 4 bars) into smaller pieces (e.g., eighths), place it in a large bowl, and microwave it in 60-second bursts on 50% power until it's mostly melted and reaches a temperature of 110-115˚F (44-46˚C), stirring after each round. I've found that this takes ~6 minutes here at 6,200 ft above sea level. To be safe, on the later rounds cut the time to 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Now break the remaining 1/4 of the chocolate into smaller pieces and add it to the bowl. Stir constantly until the new pieces melt in and the mixture reaches a temperature of 88-90˚F (32˚C).</p>
<p>Stir the almonds into the melted chocolate and pour the chocolate mixture onto a sheet of parchment paper in a baking sheet. Using a spatula, spread the mixture so that it is about 1/4 inch thick. Then sprinkle the sea salt lightly over the mixture.</p>
<p>Allow to cool to room temperature and then transfer to the refrigerator. Break into irregular pieces and store them in the fridge.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

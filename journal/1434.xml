<p>While travelling recently I made a bit of progress on the <a href="http://www.monadnock.net/epicurus/letter.html">Letter to Menoikos</a> by <a href="http://www.monadnock.net/epicurus/">Epicurus</a>. I must admit that at times people look at me strangely when I'm translating ancient Greek texts on airplanes, but for me it's the intellectual equivalent of Sudoku or some other kind of puzzle. (I'm working to complete the <cite>Letter to Menoikos</cite> by the end of the year, if possible. Stay tuned for further updates&hellip;)</p>

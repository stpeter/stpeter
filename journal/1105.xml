<p><a href="http://jeremie.com/blog/">Jeremie Miller</a> has posted some thoughts about the <a href="http://lists.wikia.com/pipermail/search-l/2007-July/000609.html">architecture of open search technologies</a>. Interesting stuff. It's a challenging space to work in, but the benefits could be enormous. With both Jer and <a href="https://jimmywales.com/">Jimbo</a> working on separate aspects of the challenge (and, I'm sure, many others eager to contribute), they just might pull it off. :)</p>

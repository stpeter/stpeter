<p>SF writer William Gibson once said: "The future is already here. It's just not very evenly distributed."</p>
<p>So I wonder: is freedom is already here, but just not very evenly distributed?</p>
<p>Or, perhaps more accurately, could that be the mantra for folks who care about human liberty? Don't try to change the world, don't try to change America, don't necessarily even try to change one state like <a href="http://www.freestateproject.org/">New Hampshire</a> or <a href="http://www.freestatewyoming.org/">Wyoming</a> (though I still think that's not a bad idea). Instead, focus on building free communities in the real world and online. Even more fundamental, focus on freeing yourself so that you can join together with others in <a href="http://www.friggasweb.org/frith.html">frith</a>.</p>
<p>Freedom does not need to be evenly distributed in order for you to live free, any more than the future needs to be evenly distributed in order for you to live now as more people will live in the future.</p>

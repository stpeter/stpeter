<p>My friend Kurt Leininger recently clued me in to the fact that William Thomas, writing in <a href="http://www.objectivistcenter.org/cth-42-1328-New_Individualist.aspx">The New Individualist</a>, had some positive to things to say about my essay "Friendship in Atlas Shrugged" (which I contributed to the volume <a href="https://www.ashgate.com/shopping/title.asp?key1=&amp;key2=&amp;orig=results&amp;isbn=0%207546%205549%200">Atlas Shrugged: A Philosophical and Literary Companion</a>). So I figure this is a good time to <a href="/writings/rand/atlasfriends.html">post it online</a> (in the public domain, naturally). Enjoy!</p>
<p>And while I'm posting <a href="/writings/rand/">Randiana</a>, I suppose I'll also upload <a href="/writings/rand/novelist.html">Ayn Rand, Novelist</a>, an essay-review of <cite>The Literary Art of Ayn Rand</cite> that was published in the Fall 2007 issue of <a href="http://www.aynrandstudies.com/">Journal of Ayn Rand Studies</a>. Now if only I could find the time to write my long-promised essay on Rand and Aristotle, I'd be just about done with my reflections on Ayn Rand. Maybe in 2009. :)</p>

<p>Tomorrow (January 28th) is Data Privacy Day. Why not join in the celebration? Here are some suggestions to prevent absolutely everything you do online from being tracked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete your Facebook account.</li>
<li>Skip the ebooks and read on paper.</li>
<li>Switch from Google Search to <a href='https://duckduckgo.com/'>DuckDuckGo</a>.</li>
<li>Switch from Gmail to FastMail, ProtonMail, or a similar service. (I've been quite happy with <a href='https://fastmail.com/'>FastMail</a>.)</li>
<li><a href='https://spreadprivacy.com/device-privacy-protection/'>Improve the privacy settings on your devices</a> (e.g., by not sharing your location).</li>
<li>Install a privacy-respecting web browser like <a href='https://firefox.com/'>Firefox</a> or <a href='https://brave.com/'>Brave</a>.</li>
<li>On your phone, switch from the default web browser (e.g., Safari) to <a href='https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2016/11/17/introducing-firefox-focus-a-free-fast-and-easy-to-use-private-browser-for-ios/'>Firefox Focus</a>. (Click the little gear icon in the upper right of the home screen to maximize your privacy settings.)</li>
<li>If you use Firefox, configure it for greater privacy by spending some quality time with the privacy and security preferences (e.g., disable history, refuse third-party cookies, and turn on tracking protection).</li>
<li>If you use Firefox, install privacy-enhancing add-ons like <a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/disconnect/'>Disconnect</a> (blocks trackers), <a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/'>uBlock Origin</a> (blocks ads), <a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/'>NoScript</a> (enables you to opt in to JavaScript code), and <a href='https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere'>HTTPS Everywhere</a> (encrypts as many of your web interactions as possible).</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm overjoyed to announce that I'm joining Mozilla, makers of the Firefox web browser. I've been using Mozilla software since Milestone 8 of the original browser release in July of 1999, so this feels like coming home. More important, Mozilla's mission of defending the open web is completely consistent with my own commitment to open source and open standards (as demonstrated through my work on Jabber/XMPP and IETF standards for the past 18 years). I have deep respect for what the Mozilla team has accomplished, both architecturally and organizationally, and I'm extremely excited about helping to make Mozilla an even stronger force for good in the world!</p>

<p>I'm a boring person. I've never gone downhill skiing, I have absolutely no interest in exciting things like skydiving or bungee jumping, and I prefer staying home reading, writing, or blogging to going out with friends or catching a concert. I like to joke that my philosophy of life is "dare to be dull". Reading <cite>Human, All Too Human</cite> the other night, I found a great quote from Nietzsche on this very topic:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Courage to be boring.</em> &mdash; Whoever lacks the courage to allow himself and his work to be found boring is certainly not a spirit of the first rank, whether in the arts or the sciences. (Volume 2, Part 1, &#xA7;25)</p></blockquote>

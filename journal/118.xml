<p>Dirk Obbink, one of my old classics professors at Columbia (well, actually he was pretty young at the time) <a href="http://www.macfound.org/programs/fel/2001fellows/obbink.htm">has been awarded</a> a MacArthur fellowship. Though I remember him mainly for a seminar on Aristotle's Poetics, he does amazing work on papyri, specifically on the burnt papyrus scrolls found in the ruins of Herculaneum (the lesser-known town destroyed in the same eruption of Mount Vesuvius that buried Pompei). Many of these papyri must have come from the library of a wealthy Epicurean, since Dirk and his colleagues have recovered a number of works by the Epicurean philosopher-poet <a href="http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/humnet/classics/philodemus/philhome.htm">Philodemus</a>. This painstaking work is also extremely valuable, since we have so few original texts from <a href="http://www.atomic-swerve.net/tpg/">Epicurus</a> himself. (Other MacArthur Fellowship winners this year include pianist <a href="http://www.macfound.org/programs/fel/2001fellows/hough.htm">Stephen Hough</a>, whom I know mainly for his duets with cellist Steven Isserlis, and composer <a href="http://www.macfound.org/programs/fel/2001fellows/sheng.htm">Bright Sheng</a>.)</p>

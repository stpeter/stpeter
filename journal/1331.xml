<p>I'll bet that the English word "outstanding" is confusing to non-native speakers, because it has two wildly divergent meanings:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Much better than others. (Cf. superlative, excellent, exceptional, extraordinary, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Not yet dealt with. (Cf. unfinished, remaining, incomplete, unpaid, etc.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I think I'll avoid this word from now on. :)</p>

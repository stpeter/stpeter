    <p>In an <a href="http://www.african-geopolitics.org/show.aspx?ArticleId=3091">interview</a> posted at african-geopolitics.org, economic historian David Landes (author of <cite>The Wealth and Povery of Nations</cite>) states:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The best indicator of the potential of growth and development of a nation is the status and role of women. Their exclusion means depriving the country of an important volume of workforce and talent. Moreover, their exclusion also undermines the desire of men to achieve success; spoiled from their childhood and treated as princes, men don't feel the need to prove themselves.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>There is, I think, much truth in that statement. But then again I'm a <a href="19.html">female chauvinist</a>.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I read a technical document that was quite interesting but in which the author repeatedly used "principal" when he meant "principle"; so to help the author remember the difference, I came up with the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>A law firm without principals has no managers.</p>
      <p>A law firm without principles is typical.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Now, some of my best friends are lawyers, so I don't mean that quite seriously, but you have to admit that it <em>is</em> easy to remember!</p>

<header><title>Poets' Paradox</title><date>2017-01-31</date></header>

<p>Here's another draft poem for my far-future book <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Poets' Paradox</strong><br/><br/>
Hearken how he says, in verse,<br/>
That the poets always lie - or worse,<br/>
To their everlasting shame,<br/>
That they ever vie for petty fame.
<br/><br/>
Their unbounded vanity<br/>
Leads them far from piety;<br/>
They live not the holy writ<br/>
Whose deed is but to utter it.
</blockquote>
<p>I think this might make a fine opening salvo, with its Nietzschean questioning of the entire enterprise of writing a cycle of poems about a poetic philosopher. The reference to the Cretan Paradox merely adds to the fun.</p>

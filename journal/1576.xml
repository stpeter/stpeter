<p>Here's another draft poem for my far-future book <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite> (I think this might make a fine opening salvo, with its Nietzschean questioning of the entire enterprise):</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>The Poets' Paradox</strong><br/><br/>
Hearken how he says, in verse,<br/>
That the poets always lie - or worse,<br/>
To their everlasting shame,<br/>
That they ever vie for petty fame.<br/>
<br/><br/>
Their unbounded vanity<br/>
Leads them far from piety.<br/>
They live not the holy writ<br/>
Whose deed is but to utter it.<br/>

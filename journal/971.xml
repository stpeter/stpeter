    <p>Thanks to a <a href="http://chimprawk.blogspot.com/2006/06/creating-social-web-of-trust-with.html">blog entry</a> from Fred Stutzman, I just discovered <a href="http://claimid.com">ClaimID</a>, "a service that lets you manage your online identity". The cool thing is that it uses the <a href="http://microid.org/">MicroID</a> technology that <a href="http://jeremie.com/">Jeremie</a> announced a few months back (this blog was probably <a href="909.html">the first website</a> in the world to use MicroIDs). So naturally I had to sign up for a <a href="http://claimid.com/stpeter">ClaimID page</a>. Not only is this a cool service, but the website is simple, intuitive, and beautiful. Well done! But I wonder if ClaimID will mind that this blog now has two MicroIDs in the meta tags&hellip;</p>

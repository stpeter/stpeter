    <p>Herewith an update about various further essays of mine on <a href="/writings/rand/">Ayn Rand</a>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>It's been over three months since the <a href="http://www.aynrandstudies.com/">Journal of Ayn Rand Studies</a> published my essay <a href="/writings/rand/randianstyle.html">Image and Integration in Ayn Rand's Descriptive Style</a> in Volume 7 Number 2, so I've posted it online under my usual public domain licensing.</p></li>
      <li><p>My essay "Friendship in Atlas Shrugged" is forthcoming in <a href="https://www.ashgate.com/shopping/title.asp?key1=&amp;key2=&amp;orig=results&amp;isbn=0%207546%205549%200">Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged: A Philosophical and Literary Companion</a>, due out in 2007 from <a href="http://www.ashgate.com/">Ashgate Publishing</a>.</p></li>
      <li><p><a href="http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/">Chris Sciabarra</a> has informed me that my essay "Nietzsche, Rand, and the Ethics of the Great Task" has been accepted for publication in a forthcoming special issue of the <a href="http://www.aynrandstudies.com/">Journal of Ayn Rand Studies</a> on Nietzsche and Rand (due out in 2007, I think).</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now I just need to write my projected essay on Aristotle and Rand, which I think will be my last rung on <a href="95.html">the ladder</a>.</p>

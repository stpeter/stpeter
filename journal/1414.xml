<p>This evening I translated a few more fragments of Epicurus, specifically numbers 34, 35, and 37 in the collection known as the <a href="http://www.monadnock.net/epicurus/vatican-sayings.html">Vatican Sayings</a>. I'm especially satisfied with my rendering of #34, because I feel that it captures Epicurus' pun on the Greek word &#x3C7;&#x3C1;&#x3B5;&#x3AF;&#x3B1;&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The use of friends is not that they are useful, but that we can trust in their usefulness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm still hoping to finish my translation of the Vatican Sayings by the end of the year&hellip;</p>

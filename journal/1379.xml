<p>I heard today that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicia_de_Larrocha">Alicia De Larrocha</a>, one of my favorite pianists, has died. I listen regularly to her recordings of Isaac Alb&#xE9;niz and Enrique Granados, whose music I <a href="/writings/essays/granados.html">adore</a>. One of my prize CDs is her long-out-of-print recording of the <cite>Seis piezas sobre cantos populares espa&#xF1;oles</cite> and <cite>Escenas rom&#xE1;nticas</cite>, but my favorite is her gorgeous rendition of the <cite>Goyescas</cite>. I doubt that anyone will ever surpass her performances of Spanish piano music.</p>

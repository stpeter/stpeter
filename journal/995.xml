    <p>Why is it that every so often someone decides to resurrect the idea of a binary encoding for <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/">XMPP</a>? The latest such plea is <a href="http://zimboe.wordpress.com/2006/09/13/i-wish-efficient-xml-encodings-for-xmpp/">here</a>.</p>
    <p>In the past I've likened the idea of "binary XMPP" to <a href="675.html">broccoli ice cream</a> -- an oddball combination that's not very tasty. And yes, I'm <a href="699.html">aware</a> of <a href="http://www.agiledelta.com/w3c_binary_xml_proposal.html">Efficient XML</a>, but I still <a href="740.html">have my doubts</a>. In any case, XMPP is simply a streaming application of XML, so any effort to define "efficient XMPP" would depend directly on the success of efforts to define "efficient XML" in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>. Working on this at the XMPP level is the wrong way to go about it. If you really care about "efficient XML", talk to the W3C.</p>
    <p>BTW, I still think the idea of "binary XML" is oxymoronic and just plain wrong. If you want a binary format, don't beat around the bush -- go ahead and define a binary format! But don't call it XML.</p>

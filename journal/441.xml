<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.clairewolfe.com/blog.html">Claire Wolfe</a>, I just found an <a href="http://www.sunnimaravillosa.com/rogues/gp/micropiece.html">amazing piece of writing</a> by a late-shift cashier at a truckstop in Mississippi. (Or so he says: perhaps that's just a persona, and the essay is pure fiction; but if it is, it's damn good fiction.) Most folks wouldn't expect much from any person in such a position. Most folks would be wrong.</p>

<header><title>Two More Nietzschean Poems</title><date>2015-06-11</date></header>
<entry>
<p>Although my philosophical focus right now is on Thoreau, I'm also thinking once in a while about <cite>Songs of Zarathustra</cite> (a cycle of poems providing a positive interpretation of Nietzsche's ethics). Here are drafts of two more poems that might make the cut. As can be seen, these are related to my previous poem <a href='1507.html'>Eternal Recurrence</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Amor Fati</strong><br/>
<p>
Whatever might unfold for me<br/>
Is not spun out by scheming Fates;<br/>
Instead it's simple destiny,<br/>
A line of life that time creates.
<br/><br/>
It's natural that I love this line,<br/>
Despite its pains and hurried pace;<br/>
Because the steps I make are mine,<br/>
I take pride in their style and grace.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wrote the first stanza of that one a month or two ago. As I was waking up this morning, the following poem (<cite>Spiral</cite>) came to me quite quickly, and then I went back and worked out a second stanza to <cite>Amor Fati</cite>. As always, these are provisional and might not survive the editor's pen.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Spiral</strong><br/>
<p>
Eternal recurrence of the same<br/>
Sounds like a circle I can't escape,<br/>
The endless march of a lowly ant<br/>
On a moebius strip of grinding fate. 
<br/><br/>
And yet the notion spurs me on<br/>
To fly and soar while I have the chance,<br/>
To make my life a thing of gold<br/>
That shines out over time and space. 
</p>

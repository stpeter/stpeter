<p>Roger Federer won his 15th Grand Slam championship today. Although it's been a while since I've watched a tennis match, I've long admired Federer's independence (for many years he toured without a coach) in addition to his consummate skill on the court. The man is almost supernatural; as evidence, I submit a gorgeous photo taken by Toby Melville of Reuters in this year's semifinal match between Federer and Tommy Haas.</p>

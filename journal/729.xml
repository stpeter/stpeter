    <p>Today I assured my second "assuree" for the <a href="http://www.cacert.org/">CAcert project</a> &mdash; George Hill of <a href="https://box.cardboard.net/">Cardboard Networks</a>, who is based in lovely <a href="http://sangres.com/places/slv/crestone.htm">Crestone, Colorado</a> but who was up in the big city of Denver today, so he stopped in. As I've said before, CAcert is a fun way to meet people (people who care about security, anyway), so try it out!</p>

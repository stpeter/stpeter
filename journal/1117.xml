<p>FWIW, I'm working on yet another <a href="/writings/rand/">essay on Ayn Rand</a>, this one entitled <a href='/writings/rand/house.html'>The House That Rand Built</a>. It's an exploration of an intriguing analogy between modernist architecture and the Randian project in philosophy. If you go in for that sort of thing, stay tuned for an initial version in the next week or so.</p>

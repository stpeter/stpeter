    <p>Last July I <a href="567.html">speculated</a> that the combination of my new PowerBook and iPod would enable me to make a short list of music that I couldn't do without. The results surprised me a bit:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Mellow Candle &mdash; Swaddling Songs</li>
      <li>J.S. Bach &mdash; Goldberg Variations</li>
      <li>Chuck Mangione &mdash; Children of Sanchez Overture</li>
      <li>J.S. Bach &mdash; The Well-Tempered Clavier</li>
      <li>J.S. Bach &mdash; Keyboard Partitas</li>
      <li>J.S. Bach &mdash; Two- and Three-Part Inventions</li>
      <li>John Bayless &mdash; Bach Meets the Beatles</li>
      <li>Yes &mdash; Fragile</li>
      <li>Yes &mdash; Close to the Edge</li>
      <li>Dougie Maclean &mdash; Craigie Dhu</li>
      <li>Eric Clapton &mdash; Me and Mr. Johnson</li>
      <li>John Bayless &mdash; Bach on Abbey Road</li>
      <li>Jacques Loussier &mdash; Plays Bach</li>
      <li>Mark Knopfler &mdash; Golden Heart</li>
      <li>Yes &mdash; Time and a Word</li>
      <li>J.S. Bach &mdash; English Suites</li>
      <li>James P. Johnson &mdash; Snowy Morning Blues</li>
      <li>Renaissance &mdash; Tales of 1001 Nights</li>
      <li>Abbey Lincoln &mdash; You Gotta Pay the Band</li>
      <li>Yes &mdash; Yes</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The preponderance of Bach is no big shock, but I would've expected more Yes and at least some Ellington. But the foregoing list reflects only what I've been listening to most in the last eight months or so &mdash; I got a bit burnt out on Yes there for a while, listened to Mellow Candle's <a href="653.html">Swaddling Songs</a> a few times a week last fall (!), went on a similar <a href="633.html">John Bayless kick</a>, and often listen to some recordings via CD at home so they don't get counted (I'm thinking especially of Joe Pass, Ella Fitzgerald, Mollie O'Brien, Paul Desmond, and Marian McPartland). It'll be interesting to observe the long-term trends (say, over three or five years).</p>

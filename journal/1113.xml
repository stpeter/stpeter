<p>As I argued recently regarding "copyright", <a href="1078.html">language matters</a>. So I was disappointed with the most recent policy study from <a href="http://www.perc.org/">PERC</a>, entitled <a href="http://www.perc.org/perc.php?subsection=6&amp;id=895">Trading Forest Carbon: The Panacea or Pipe Dream to Address Climate Change</a>. The substance of the study isn't necessarily objectionable, but I didn't like the author's use of terms like "greenhouse gases". Calling carbon dioxide (but nothing about methane?) a greenhouse gas concedes the (IMHO unproven) assertion that the current period of climate change is caused by human industrial activity, not by <a href="1102.html">solar activity</a> or other phenomena. As far as I can see, climatology is still a <a href="1059.html">young science</a> and we simply do not yet know the causes for what warming is occurring (and by knowledge I refer to provable statements and falsifiable theories, not pseudo-scientific "models" and political <a href="1077.html">consensus</a>). So why throw around loose terms like "greenhouse gases"? That's just sloppy thinking if you ask me. I expect more from the good folks at PERC.</p>

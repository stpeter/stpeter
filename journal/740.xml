    <p>Thanks to a <a href="http://copia.ogbuji.net/blog/2005-04-23/One_Binary">pointer</a> provided by <a href="http://copia.ogbuji.net/blog/">Uche Ogbuji</a>, I've just read an <a href="http://www.www2004.org/proceedings/docs/1p345.pdf">interesting paper</a> on "binary XML" written by some researchers at IBM. Previously I've called binary XML the equivalent of <a href="675.html">broccoli ice cream</a>, and I continue to doubt if it's something we need for <a href="https://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a>, especially given that we have compression methods both as part of <a href="https://xmpp.org/specs/rfc3920.html#tls">TLS</a> and in standalone form as specified in <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0138.html">JEP-0138: Stream Compression</a> (for which the Last Call ends tomorrow).</p>

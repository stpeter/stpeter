    <p>I've just posted the first draft of a new essay entitled <a href="/writings/rand/pop.html">Toward a Practical Objectivist Politics</a>.</p>
    <p>My personal goal for December is to finish all but one of my <a href="/writings/rand/">essays on Ayn Rand and Objectivism</a>. The exception is my essay on Rand and Aristotle, which I won't write until I finish re-reading all of Aristotle's writings, and that will take me a while (Aristotle wrote a lot!). This essay on practical Objectivist politics was on my list of essays to write. The other three I plan to finish this month are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Friends, Lovers, and Comrades: Chosen Relationships in Atlas Shrugged</li>
      <li>The Mind on Strike: Atlas Shrugged as the Revolt of the Engineers</li>
      <li>Objectivism Without Platonism: Hao Wang on Kurt G&amp;#xF6;del</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I simply must finish the first one, since I've promised it to <a href="http://www.quebecoislibre.org/apyounkins.htm">Ed Younkins</a> for a book he's shopping around to publishers (in fact, I was supposed to have it done a month ago). The essay on the revolt of the engineers is mostly written, but I need to work in results of some more research I've done of late. And the paper on Kurt G&amp;#xF6;del and his interpreter Hao Wang is something I've had lying around for many years but have never finished up, so I think the end-of-year deadline will motivate me to complete it. Then I'll need only to finish the Aristotle essay and I'll be ready to <a href="530.html">let go</a> of <a href="95.html">the ladder</a>.</p>

    <p>Last night after the IETF plenary session I happened to be part of a small gathering of geeks who among other things were speaking of how IPv6 will eventually supplant IPv4, so I spontaneously (well, after some coaxing) came up with the following limerick:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        There once was a man named Al Gore,<br/>
        Who thought that the phone could do more;<br/>
        He invented the Net,<br/>
        But we'll do better yet,<br/>
        For he only developed 'v4.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To the universal deployment of IPv6!</p>

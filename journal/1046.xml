    <p>Michael Barone has a fascinating analysis of some county-level American census data <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/opinion/baroneblog/archives/070118/net_internal_mi.htm">here</a>. His conclusions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Americans continue to flee the central cities, especially New York, San Francisco, Chicago, L.A., and Boston.</li>
      <li>That outmigration is tempered somewhat by immigration from outside the U.S., but only in L.A. does immigration offset internal outmigration.</li>
      <li>The true American boomtowns today are Phoenix, Las Vegas, Tampa, Atlanta, and Orlando.</li>
      <li>Americans continue to move south and west in droves.</li>
      <li>Almost all the exploding counties tend to vote conservative Republican, almost all the imploding counties tend to vote liberal Democratic.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The results comport with the research of <a href="http://www.joelkotkin.com/">Joel Kotkin</a> &mdash; though it would also be interesting to look at percentage increases and decreases rather than raw numbers.</p>

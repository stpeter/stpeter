<p>Today a friend asked me about more of my secrets for personal productivity. I still think that <a href='1466.html'>having a strong to-don't list</a> and <a href='1522.html'>staying on a low-information diet</a> are key factors in how I get so much done. However, reflecting further, I came up with a few more reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I focus in areas where I have a comparative advantage because I have practiced and honed my skills: in particular, technology (especially the intersection between technology and business) and writing (especially works that serious thinkers would consider to be pop philosophy).</li>
<li>I work on many projects in parallel. Right now I am writing or doing research on both Thoreau and Aristotle. I have a number of technical projects underway at work and in the industry standards arena. And I continue to nurture some of my musical projects (I have at least four records to make and I endeavor to practice this music somewhat regularly so that I don't forget how to play it). On occasion, I devote a burst of activity to one of my various projects in order to nudge it forward or to finish it. I think it might seem that I am more productive than I really am, because something new is always being published or completed. </li>
<li>Somehow I'm able to change focus quickly and keep things in memory over long spans of time (which might be related to the fact that I work on projects in parallel). Because of work and life schedules, I don't often have large blocks of time for my philosophical or musical projects (even though I wish I did!), so I have learned how to make the best use of whatever small blocks of time I have available (typically, the hour or two before I go to sleep, a few hours on Sundays, and plane and hotel time when I travel for work). The same goes for many of my technical projects, too.</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps based on these three factors, I gestate on topics for long periods of time (I was thinking on and off about my book on Rand for <a href='1487.html'>seventeen years</a>, and since my days at Columbia I've never really stopped thinking about Aristotle here and there). Thus when I finally do sit down to work on a topic intensively, I can often make fast progress.</p>
<p>Mostly, though, I just work hard...</p>

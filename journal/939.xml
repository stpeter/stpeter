    <p>These days I eat lunch alone at my desk. For three or four years I had lunch just about every workday with <a href="928.html">Peter Millard</a>. There is something special about breaking bread with a friend and talking about anything you please. We had some great, wide-ranging conversations over the years, which I sorely miss.</p>
    <p>BTW, the Rocky Mountain News has published an <a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/obituaries/article/0,1299,DRMN_45_4698825,00.html">obituary</a> of Peter.</p>

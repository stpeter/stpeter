<p>A Jabber acquaintance of mine in Istanbul let me know about the poet Nazim Hikmet, whom I'd never heard of before. Naturally I can't read his poetry in Turkish so I'm sure I'm missing a lot. Hikmet is probably best known for his poem "On Living", which begins like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Living is no laughing matter:<br/>
you must live with great seriousness<br/>
like a squirrel, for example --<br/>
I mean without looking for something beyond and above living,<br/>
I mean living must be your whole occupation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also like the following (one of his "9-10 P.M. Poems"):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most beautiful sea hasn't been crossed yet.<br/>
The most beautiful child hasn't grown up yet.<br/>
Our most beautiful days we haven't seen yet.<br/>
And the most beautiful words I wanted to tell you I haven't said yet...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The translations are by Randy Blasing and Mutlu Konuk. I'll try to find links for them and for Hikmet.</p>

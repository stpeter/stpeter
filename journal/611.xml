    <p>I was going to blog some more this evening about the <a href="http://www.thenation.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20041122&amp;s=sifry">role of technology</a> in the recent U.S. elections, <a href="http://www.personaldemocracy.com/node/view/120">lessons for future campaigns</a>, <a href="http://yglesias.typepad.com/matthew/2004/11/big_government_.html">big-government conservatism</a>, <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/08/the_bush_vision.html">proper priorities</a> for Bush's second term and <a href="http://reti.blogspot.com/2004/08/vision-i-can-live-with.html">why they won't be pursued</a>, even the impact of <a href="http://www.aei.org/news/newsID.21076,filter.all/news_detail.asp">American demographic exceptionalism</a> (not to mention moral and religious exceptionalism) on the next new few election cycles (hint: Hillary faces an uphill battle in '08). But then I decided that I'm tired of blogging about politics. So my apologies for the interruption &mdash; we now return to our regularly scheduled programming&hellip;</p>

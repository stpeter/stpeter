<p>The <a href="http://www.libertarian.co.uk/">Libertarian Alliance</a> in London has published two more of my essays: "Hugo, Rand, and the Purpose of Art" is <a href="http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/cultn/cultn048.pdf">Cultural Notes #48</a> and "The Art of Friendship" is <a href="http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/cultn/cultn049.pdf">Cultural Notes #49</a>. I especially like the images that Nigel Meek added to the PDF versions.</p>

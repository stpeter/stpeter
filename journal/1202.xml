<p>Over at <a href="http://cafehayek.typepad.com/">Cafe Hayek</a>, Russell Roberts has dug up the following quote from candidate George Bush during a debate with Al Gore on October 3rd, 2000:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would take the use of force very seriously.  I would be guarded in my approach.  I don't think we can be all things to all people in the world.  I think we've got to be very careful when we commit our troops.  The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops.  He believes in nation building.  I would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders.  I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.</p>

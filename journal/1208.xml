<p>I've been working some more on monadnock.net. I really like the idea of publishing public domain texts of significance -- exercising taste and judgment in selecting important works to make available for free in easy-to-read formats. After the <a href='1192.html'>initial uploads</a>, I recently posted the Essays: First Series by <a href="http://monadnock.net/emerson/">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a> and some poems by <a href="http://monadnock.net/marvell/">Andrew Marvell</a>. Maybe I'll need to create a blog at monadnock.net to announce these site updates... :)</p>

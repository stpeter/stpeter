    <p>Have you ever thought about what it's like to be dumb? I know that I am not the smartest person on the planet, but sometimes you meet someone and you look into their dull vacant eyes and (as Gertrude Stein said about Oakland) you realize that there's no there there. Probably there are incredibly smart people who have the same feeling about me (yes, you know who you are -- I've seen that look). The experience must be quite common, because we have so many phrases for stupidity in the English language. Indeed, a guy named Dan Hersham has <a href="http://dan.hersam.com/lists/not_bright.html">collected them</a> and his list runs to 127 entries! Here are some of my favorites:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The lights are on but nobody's home.</li>
      <li>The elevator doesn't go all the way to the top.</li>
      <li>Not the sharpest knife in the drawer.</li>
      <li>Not the brightest light on the Christmas tree.</li>
      <li>A few screws short of a hardware store.</li>
      <li>A few sandwiches short of a picnic.</li>
      <li>A few fries short of a Happy Meal.</li>
      <li>A few clowns short of a circus.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But he's missing one of my favorites, which we used back in Maine when I was growing up: "Only got half a cord in the woodshed." :-)</p>
    <p>And another: "The elevator goes to the top but the doors don't open."</p>

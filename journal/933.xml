    <p>A few blocks away from my house over at the <a href="http://www.du.edu/">University of Denver</a>, the Iliff School of Theology recently held a lecture in its continuing series on "Cultural Contexts of Queerness", entitled "Homosexuality in Southern Africa and Gender Fluidity in African Divination Practices" (with a special focus on Zimbabwe). I am not making this up. Where do they get this stuff? How out of touch can academics be if they don't realize that the poor people suffering under the <a href="http://www.worldpress.org/Africa/2200.cfm">military dictatorship</a> of Robert Mugabe have a lot more to worry about in life than the role of gender fluidity in African divination practices?</p>
